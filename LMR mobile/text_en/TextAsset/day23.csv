text31649;"""I was dreaming that Himitsu and I were marooned on a deserted island."""
text31650;"""But not like the ones described in Dafoe's novels. You could say it was a five-star one: with a restaurant, a bar, a huge bed, bathrooms, and even a movie theater."""
text31651;"""Except, there were no other people but us: the food, as often happens in dreams, appeared by itself, the weather was perfect — there were no tropical rains or monsoons whatsoever."""
text31652;"""I was drinking wine and couldn't get drunk, it had an abnormally sweet taste you'd never find in real life. <w>Sugary, savory, overwhelming and addictive like a drug."""
text31653;"""Heavy pink fog covered everything before my eyes, my movements were slow and smooth, as if I were doing gymnastics in water."""
text31654;"""I'd get instantly teleported from the bar to the rollercoasters, but even there it felt like I was swimming on them, like a woodchip on waves."""
text31655;"""And then I went up to the sky and flew…"""
text31656;"""A skyscraper appeared on the other end of the island, I fluttered into an open window and found myself in Himitsu's arms."""
text31657;"""We were making love to each other, slowly and meticulously, as if we had done it many times."""
text31658;"""But then somebody was knocking loudly and persistently on the door, again and again."""
text31659;"""Irina stormed into the room and started shouting something in a language I didn't know."""
text31660;"""I turned to Himitsu, but she disappeared, and Catherine was lying in her place and giving me a devilish smile."""
text31661;"""I was terrified, overwhelmed by a primal fear, and as her eyes gleamed brighter and brighter I could see the fires of hell through them."""
text31662;"""Catherine's mother appeared in Irina's place."""
text31663;"""She was smiling the same exact way as her daughter."""
text31664;"""Then they vanished completely, but everything was filled with their eyes, flaming with the primal evil and anger of those banished from Heaven…"""
text31665;"""In films, we often see the main character wake up in the middle of the night and abruptly sit up in bed, covered in cold sweat and gasping for air."""
text31666;"""Of course, stuff like this also happens in real life, but extremely rarely."""
text31667;"""I didn't know if I had had a nightmare, but despite the fact that I could still remember the horror I experienced in the dream, I woke up feeling pretty alright."""
text31668;"""It was six o'clock in the morning, which meant that I still had about an hour to finish watching my dream."""
text31669;"""Although the thoughts that started swarming in my head with an insane intensity kept me from it."""
text31670;"""My memories of yesterday became clearer by the moment."""
text31671;"""Today I had to meet Mrs Winters again — there was no reason to think that she would just give up."""
text31672;"""Ryunosuke-san couldn't help — regardless of whether he didn't want or wasn't able to."""
text31673;"""And then there was Irina, who also expected something from me."""
text31674;"""Now was definitely a good time to start panicking!"""
text31675;"""I got up, walked into the garden wearing just my pants, shivering at the morning chill."""
text31676;"""Drops of dew gleamed on the grass, looking as if a cut-glass carpet lay at my feet, so fragile that the first step onto it would shatter the whole thing to pieces."""
text31677;"""I stepped down from the porch and felt a pleasant chill under my feet."""
text31678;"""The sun was starting its workday behind the roofs in the east, shining almost reluctantly as if doing a heavy duty."""
text31679;"""The year must've tired it out too."""
text31680;"""I washed myself, brushed my teeth, walked into the kitchen, and froze in front of the fridge."""
text31681;"""Was Himitsu going to cook something in the morning, perhaps? <w>Then it would make sense to wait for her."""
text31682;"""On the other hand, it was such a stupid thought!"""
text31683;"""I sighed and put the kettle on the stove."""
text31684;"""If Catherine's mother came again, I'd give her those documents, screw them!"""
text31685;"""Maybe that wasn't what she wanted, but I had nothing else!"""
text31686;"""Maybe she'd see that I was willing to cooperate and leave me alone…"""
text31687;"""When I brewed the tea, the front door opened quietly and Himitsu appeared in the kitchen."""
text31688;"""Niko-kun, you're already up?"""
text31689;"""It was indeed weird."""
text31690;"""Good morning."""
text31691;"""That's good. Unexpected though."""
text31692;"""She looked at the two cups that were standing on the table in front of me, then at the stove."""
text31693;"""Well, let's have breakfast."""
text31694;"""Her voice sounded unsure — was she really that surprised?"""
text31695;"""Himitsu was cooking something, while I was still sitting motionlessly, drinking tea and thinking about the imminence of death. <w>Strange thing to think about for an eighteen year old school kid."""
text31696;"""But it's stupid to ignore what you know is coming."""
text31697;"""I just really didn't want to drag Himitsu into this!"""
text31698;"""For the last few weeks, my desire to protect her from literally everything was fighting with a, somewhat unhealthy, need to be fully honest with her."""
text31699;"""Niko-kun, you're not yourself this morning."""
text31700;"""I just had a very weird dream. A postmodern one, in a sense."""
text31701;"""About what?"""
text31702;"""I don't really remember… You know when you've forgotten a dream but still feel the aftertaste of it?"""
text31703;"""Hm…"""
text31704;"""She didn't believe it."""
text31705;"""In order to avoid continuing this conversation, I turned the TV on."""
text31706;"""Another young politician was standing for election, another corrupt official had been caught, another big car accident with dozens of victims."""
text31707;"""As if somewhere inside the TV set, right behind the kinescope, there was a production line making and broadcasting the same stories."""
text31708;"""I wondered if these people really existed, if they would still have died had I not turned on the TV today at seven o'clock in the morning."""
text31709;"""Maybe it was just an \""Instant Use Set for Real Life\"" from Kobayashi Corporation, one item, 9999 yen with a 30% discount?"""
text31710;"""An everyday, ready-to-use set of events — just add water!"""
text31711;"""The necessary volume of well-balanced informational noise that contained the required amount of vitamins and trace elements?"""
text31712;"""A plate of <note=note111>omurice</note> landed on the table in front of me with a loud bang."""
text31713;"""I can't believe I'm saying this, but you should have slept more."""
text31714;"""Himitsu looked displeased."""
text31715;"""Maybe."""
text31716;"""And, by the way, Niko-kun, thanks for buying plates."""
text31717;"""No problem…"""
text31718;"""Why would she need to thank <i>me</i> for that?"""
text31719;"""Breaking dishes really helps."""
text31720;"""Break as many as you want."""
text31721;"""I felt a bit embarrassed and even uncomfortable being alone with her."""
text31722;"""Well, within reason! I'm not doing very well financially right now."""
text31723;"""What's wrong with your finances?"""
text31724;"""Himitsu was immediately alerted."""
text31725;"""Yeah, that was another thing I needed to discuss with Ryunosuke-san."""
text31726;"""My life had suddenly become much too focused on him, and he wasn't too eager to show initiative."""
text31727;"""But this definitely wasn't a matter worth hiding."""
text31728;"""Due to unknown causes, my bank account has been frozen."""
text31729;"""Niko-kun…"""
text31730;"""Yeah, not the most pleasant situation ever."""
text31731;"""I'll talk to dad!"""
text31732;"""She said with determination."""
text31733;"""I'm sure he can help you."""
text31734;"""Sure. Thank you."""
text31735;"""I wished he'd help me stay alive first."""
text31736;"""A dead man needs no possessions."""
text31737;"""Only then did I notice that Himitsu had drawn a heart on my omelette with ketchup."""
text31738;"""Anyway, to other matters…"""
text31739;"""I took the bottle, slowly came to Himitsu, and carefully drew something that more resembled a triangle on her plate."""
text31740;"""Sorry, I draw about as well as I cook."""
text31741;"""She just wrapped her arms around my neck and pulled me to her without saying a word."""
text31742;"""We were kissing for so long the food got cold."""
text31743;"""Of course I wanted to go further, but Himitsu pushed me away lightly and said quietly:"""
text31744;"""We'll be late for school."""
text31745;"""…"""
text31746;"""It was much warmer outside. <w>As if September was giving us its farewell smile."""
text31747;"""We met Saya-chan at the gates."""
text31748;"""Together again?"""
text31749;"""She smirked in place of a greeting."""
text31750;"""We're always together!"""
text31751;"""Sure, sure…"""
text31752;"""She cast a glance at me."""
text31753;"""You might not be that much of a jerk after all, senpai."""
text31754;"""Saya-chan!"""
text31755;"""I'll take that as a compliment."""
text31756;"""Think what you will, but I need to steal Himitsu from you."""
text31757;"""She grabbed Himitsu by the arm and dragged her along."""
text31758;"""I wanted to kiss her goodbye – I didn't care that we were in the middle of the school yard, surrounded by a crowd of acquaintances and strangers."""
text31759;"""But Saya-chan was faster than that."""
text31760;"""See you."""
text31761;"""That was the only thing I managed to say, and Himitsu waved her hand and smiled, putting all her love into it."""
text31762;"""The day started well!"""
text31763;"""So, I loved Himitsu."""
text31764;"""Everything else aside, I had to somehow live with that…"""
text31765;"""In reality, it's not enough to just confess your love and know that it's mutual."""
text31766;"""A lot of work lay ahead… <w>Work something always stood in the way of!"""
text31767;"""Catherine appeared in the classroom right before the bell and walked to her desk without looking at anyone."""
text31768;"""I didn't turn around, but I could feel her staring at my back."""
text31769;"""To be frank, I didn't expect Katya to come to school after what had happened."""
text31770;"""I had every reason to blame her!"""
text31771;"""Yesterday, Catherine saw me and Himitsu together and clearly indicated that she wasn't happy about it — the same evening I found her mother in my kitchen!"""
text31772;"""The causal link in this sequence of events was a little too obvious!"""
text31773;"""I barely held myself back until the break, and approached her desk right after the bell rang."""
text31774;"""We need to talk. Now!"""
text31775;"""I said quietly, but in a tone that clearly indicated that I wouldn't take no for an answer."""
text31776;"""We walked into the corridor."""
text31777;"""During first recess students are usually only just starting to wake up, so they don't run down the corridors like herds of horses."""
text31778;"""Anyway, we could be sure that no one would eavesdrop on us, even by accident."""
text31779;"""I don't know what kind of story you made up, but you really shouldn't have dragged your mother into this!"""
text31780;"""I have no idea what you're talking about."""
text31781;"""She replied with a bored expression."""
text31782;"""Stop it, this isn't a game anymore! You know, I thought better of you."""
text31783;"""So did I of you."""
text31784;"""Whatever I… Whatever happened between us, this is going too far! Nobody shoots a cannon at sparrows!"""
text31785;"""Or do you really want to drive me into an early grave?"""
text31786;"""I frowned and stared at her."""
text31787;"""Catherine didn't last long."""
text31788;"""You have the nerve to accuse me of anything?"""
text31789;"""Her face twitched. Catherine wrapped her arms around herself and looked out the window."""
text31790;"""You think you're the one having a hard time?"""
text31791;"""Do you know how long I'd been blaming myself?"""
text31792;"""Do you have any idea how hard it was for me?"""
text31793;"""Her voice was getting louder and louder."""
text31794;"""And you…"""
text31795;"""You just dumped me for her!"""
text31796;"""Catherine was shouting."""
text31797;"""What…"""
text31798;"""I dumped Catherine for… <w>Himitsu?"""
text31799;"""What kind of nonsense was that?!"""
text31800;"""Stop pretending! How can you even dare to accuse me of something!?"""
text31801;"""Do you want to know what I told my mother?"""
text31802;"""Nothing!"""
text31803;"""Her performance, of course, didn't go unnoticed, but Catherine clearly didn't care."""
text31804;"""Even though I should've! After everything <i>you two</i> have done to me!"""
text31805;"""Wait, calm down!"""
text31806;"""But she didn't seem to hear me, continuing her outburst even in front of the curious students who had gathered around us."""
text31807;"""It felt like Catherine wasn't really talking to me, just venting everything she had pent up inside her."""
text31808;"""And to think I was really trying find some justification for your behavior!"""
text31809;"""Ha! I'm such an idiot! I so deserved it!"""
text31810;"""Catherine was crying and swinging her arms, her long hair was sticking to her face, now wet with tears — she had lost any resemblance to a well mannered lady."""
text31811;"""I had never seen her like this."""
text31812;"""Like a volcano finally erupting."""
text31813;"""It had been holding back for thousands of years, accumulating fiery fury inside of it."""
text31814;"""And now it was exploding, covering everything for kilometers around in its scorching lava and ash."""
text31815;"""I don't know what I did to upset you this much, but…"""
text31816;"""You don't know?!"""
text31817;"""She grinned sadly and, with effort, threw her hands up in the air, apparently tired of her own hysteria."""
text31818;"""\""Birds of a feather flock together\"" – that's you two!"""
text31819;"""Can you just explain properly what, in your opinion, I did wrong?"""
text31820;"""If you really don't know, that's even ironic in a sense."""
text31821;"""Because it means that <i>she</i> succeeded in everything she'd planned."""
text31822;"""What are you even talking about?!"""
text31823;"""I lost myself and snapped into a shout as well…"""
text31824;"""You're so pathetic…"""
text31825;"""Catherine hissed."""
text31826;"""The Japanese say a person has <note=note112>three faces</note> — so then had I never even seen her second?"""
text31827;"""I'm tired of this guessing game!"""
text31828;"""Fuck you!"""
text31829;"""Catherine said hatefully through clenched teeth and returned to the classroom, just to leave it again after a few seconds – with her bag."""
text31830;"""Her farewell look was filled with enough hatred to genuinely terrify me."""
text31831;"""And I was left as the sole point of interest."""
text31832;"""What are you all staring at? Show's over, go away!"""
text31833;"""I said sadly and dragged my feet back to the classroom."""
text31834;"""After that scene, my upcoming conversation with Mrs Winters was probably literally life threatening!"""
text31835;"""If Catherine's words had been enough for her to come to my place and start threatening me, I didn't even want to imagine what she would do now, after her daughter had this kind of an outburst…"""
text31836;"""And most importantly — Katya sincerely believed that I was guilty of something."""
text31837;"""Something that couldn't be forgiven."""
text31838;"""And the last straw for her was what Himitsu did yesterday at the school gate – grabbed at me, showing that I was hers, and Catherine had to keep her hands off!"""
text31839;"""Was it jealousy?"""
text31840;"""Everything could be easily explained by banal jealousy. <w>But not in Catherine's case."""
text31841;"""There was something else, something she believed сompletely, without even a shade of doubt."""
text31842;"""Maybe if I had given her more of my attention…"""
text31843;"""But now I was with Himitsu, so it was pointless to even think about that."""
text31844;"""…"""
text31845;"""My mood was ruined. <w>When I had thought it couldn't get worse — Ryunosuke-san, Mrs Winters, Irina…"""
text31846;"""And now Catherine too!"""
text31847;"""I'd have to tell Himitsu about our <i>talk</i> – she would find out about it sooner or later anyway. <w>In this school, rumors spread fast."""
text31848;"""Should never think things can't get worse…"""
text31849;"""What do you mean?"""
text31850;"""I didn't have a bento today — we were sitting in the canteen and eating oversalted <note=note68>udon</note>."""
text31851;"""I mean, sometimes it seems that this is it, you've reached the bottom… And when it does, someone will knock from below."""
text31852;"""What do you mean, knock from below? How can they if it's the bottom?"""
text31853;"""Ohh…"""
text31854;"""It seemed I'd picked up the habit of sighing all the time from someone, with and without reason."""
text31855;"""Although unfortunately I had more than enough reasons, recently."""
text31856;"""So! We never talked… Are you and Himitsu-chan together now? I mean, <i>officially</i>?"""
text31857;"""Why do you want to know?"""
text31858;"""Well, I'm your friend – and friends don't hide these things from each other!"""
text31859;"""I wondered if anybody had ever told him that the way he smiles sometimes makes people want to stand up and leave..."""
text31860;"""But what difference did it make now?"""
text31861;"""It couldn't be worse… <w>After all, Kyosuke couldn't change my situation in any way, and he had helped me a lot before."""
text31862;"""Well, you could say we are."""
text31863;"""And…"""
text31864;"""He starting whispering conspiratorially and leaned closer, putting his belly on the table."""
text31865;"""You've already done the thing, right? You know…"""
text31866;"""Enough!"""
text31867;"""I stopped him short and stood up; my bowl of cold udon was almost full."""
text31868;"""My classmates kept throwing wary glances at me all the way until the end of the school day."""
text31869;"""The Japanese have this special look — like, we don't mean anything bad and won't say it to your face, but we've heard that you're an antisocial person, and we're non-verbally letting you know just that."""
text31870;"""And I wouldn't even care much — but when the majority of the class behaves this way, it starts to feel outright nasty."""
text31871;"""It was like torture by collective silent condemnation."""
text31872;"""I wasn't really well-integrated into any Japanese social structures, but I had lived by this society's norms and rules for a decade."""
text31873;"""However, now I had Himitsu — and these trifles meant much less to me!"""
text31874;"""Class was over. I walked down the stairs, changed my shoes, and began to wait."""
text31875;"""Niko-kun!"""
text31876;"""Himitsu fluttered out of the school like a dove from its cage, giving me a special smile I had never seen before."""
text31877;"""You're shining like a penny."""
text31878;"""Just enjoying the good weather. And happy that class is over. And that we're going home together."""
text31879;"""Yeah, I barely sat until the end. I'm really hungry."""
text31880;"""Haven't you had lunch?"""
text31881;"""I have… Well, tried to. But the cooks get a big fat F from me today!"""
text31882;"""Niko-kun…"""
text31883;"""Himitsu's eyes went round."""
text31884;"""Sorry for not making you bento today!"""
text31885;"""The only thing missing was a ground-deep bow…"""
text31886;"""I smirked in good nature."""
text31887;"""Come on, it's alright."""
text31888;"""I'll definitely make you one tomorrow!"""
text31889;"""Sure."""
text31890;"""All the way home Himitsu talked about the school festival that was just around the corner."""
text31891;"""As for me, the closer we came to my place, the more nervous I became."""
text31892;"""Ryunosuke-san was supposed to talk to me after school."""
text31893;"""Which meant – right now. <w>But not while Himitsu was around!"""
text31894;"""I decided to drop by my house first."""
text31895;"""Alright, so…"""
text31896;"""We stopped at my gate."""
text31897;"""Are you going to tell me you're busy again?"""
text31898;"""She squinted slyly."""
text31899;"""And you aren't?"""
text31900;"""Well…"""
text31901;"""She thought for a moment."""
text31902;"""Nothing urgent. Besides, I need to make some food for you first!"""
text31903;"""She got me! <w>And I'd cornered myself, too…"""
text31904;"""Yeah, but… Let's meet in half an hour. My stomach isn't feeling well after that udon."""
text31905;"""I smiled apologetically."""
text31906;"""Boo! Fine!"""
text31907;"""She smiled merrily and ran to her house."""
text31908;"""It seemed like I had dodged a bullet."""
text31909;"""I slowly walked into the yard, stepped onto the porch, grabbed the doorknob… <w>and immediately realized something was wrong."""
text31910;"""It happens: if you live in the same house your entire life, any small difference, sometimes even some sort of unconscious premonition can be enough to realize that something is wrong!"""
text31911;"""There was someone inside!"""
text31912;"""Mrs Winters? <w>It was too early for her."""
text31913;"""Irina...?"""
text31914;"""If so, her visit meant nothing good."""
text31915;"""Suddenly I was pulled away, like a doll on invisible thread."""
text31916;"""I couldn't go in under any circumstance, even on fear of death."""
text31917;"""I returned to the street and stopped, hesitating."""
text31918;"""The only sensible course of action was to go to Ryunosuke-san… <w>But Himitsu was there."""
text31919;"""Did I really have a choice though?"""
text31920;"""Even if she got to know the <i>whole</i> truth, would it make things worse for anyone? <w>Worse than <i>now</i>?"""
text31921;"""Ding-dong."""
text31922;"""The bell at Ito's house sounded like it came right out of a Disney cartoon."""
text31923;"""Like the door was about to be answered by Snow White and the seven dwarves."""
text31924;"""And even though the Snow White part wasn't that hard to believe, she also lived together with the evil king."""
text31925;"""Niko-kun...?"""
text31926;"""Contrary to expectations, Himitsu opened the door."""
text31927;"""Did something happen?"""
text31928;"""She seemed to have guessed."""
text31929;"""No. Yes… I need to talk to your father."""
text31930;"""About what?"""
text31931;"""Can you call him?"""
text31932;"""Himitsu frowned."""
text31933;"""Niko-kun, something's wrong, it's written on your face."""
text31934;"""…"""
text31935;"""Nikolai."""
text31936;"""Ryunosuke-san appeared in the hallway."""
text31937;"""It's okay, we're just going to talk. Go."""
text31938;"""He told his daughter."""
text31939;"""But dad…"""
text31940;"""Go."""
text31941;"""He said in a firmer tone."""
text31942;"""Himitsu's expression darkened and she left, giving me an angry look."""
text31943;"""Her father and I walked into the yard."""
text31944;"""He waited a minute to ensure that nobody was eavesdropping on us."""
text31945;"""You look scared."""
text31946;"""Yes, and I have a reason! I think… I'm sure there's someone in my house! Maybe Catherine's mother… Maybe the KGB… Who the hell knows!"""
text31947;"""Did you see them?"""
text31948;"""No, but it's clear anyway."""
text31949;"""Oh, Nikolai, Nikolai… It's always something with you!"""
text31950;"""With me? Is it my fault? If it was up to me… You promised to help me!"""
text31951;"""I didn't promise anything. And I'm tired of beating around the bush. When you give me your parents' documents, you will get protection."""
text31952;"""What?"""
text31953;"""I understood each of his words separately, but my brain was resolutely refusing to put them together."""
text31954;"""Ryunosuke-san, I don't understand…"""
text31955;"""As you can see, <i>everybody</i> needs those documents, and without them we can't break this stalemate."""
text31956;"""But I don't have them! God damn it, how many times do I have to say it!"""
text31957;"""Nikolai, you shouting won't help the situation."""
text31958;"""I was such an idiot!"""
text31959;"""Finally, everything became crystal clear."""
text31960;"""So this was your plan from the very beginning? To use Himitsu one way or the other?!"""
text31961;"""Did you think I would just give Himitsu to you? Ha! With you is where she's in the most danger!"""
text31962;"""You're a monster!"""
text31963;"""Documents, Nikolai. I never believed you don't have them."""
text31964;"""Torture me if you will…"""
text31965;"""Except that now I really had them!"""
text31966;"""You're the devil incarnate…"""
text31967;"""Himitsu can't stay with you in the same house a second longer…"""
text31968;"""I was muttering and staggered to the door."""
text31969;"""Where do you think you're going?"""
text31970;"""He tried to grab me by the arm, but in the same moment the whole world seemed to slow down, adrenaline hit my brain, I easily dodged him and jumped onto the porch."""
text31971;"""Himitsu!"""
text31972;"""She was in the kitchen, cooking dinner."""
text31973;"""Niko-kun...?"""
text31974;"""Her big green eyes were looking at me in surprise, she was holding a knife in the air, the water in the pot was boiling, and oil was sizzling in the frying pan."""
text31975;"""The sound of Ito's steps from behind made me come to my senses."""
text31976;"""We need to go! Hurry!"""
text31977;"""You little shit!"""
text31978;"""Ryunosuke-san stormed into the house next to me and grabbed me by the collar."""
text31979;"""Get out of here!"""
text31980;"""Dad!"""
text31981;"""Himitsu shouted and ran to us."""
text31982;"""I flew at him and caught him on the cheekbone."""
text31983;"""Ryunosuke-san threw me through the door as hard as he could, and I slid along the corridor, painfully smashing my back on a corner."""
text31984;"""Dad, stop!"""
text31985;"""Himitsu, go to your room!"""
text31986;"""Dad!"""
text31987;"""This bastard will never set foot in my house again!"""
text31988;"""Niko-kun."""
text31989;"""She tried to come closer to me, but her father grabbed her firmly by the arm."""
text31990;"""You know what you need to do. Now get out! Get out of here!"""
text31991;"""Ito howled in a voice not his own."""
text31992;"""I shifted my eyes to Himitsu."""
text31993;"""She was trying to break free, but somehow sluggishly, as if carried by inertia."""
text31994;"""What was I supposed to do?"""
text31995;"""Get into a fight with an enemy who was probably stronger than me?"""
text31996;"""Turn tail and run?"""
text31997;"""With difficulty I stood up on my feet, sharp pain hitting me in the lower back."""
text31998;"""Bring the documents and we will continue this conversation."""
text31999;"""He said in a calmer tone."""
text32000;"""It was unbelievable how a single person could combine such a strong dislike of me with an absolute loyalty to his job."""
text32001;"""Niko-kun…"""
text32002;"""Himitsu prattled powerlessly, completely ceasing to resist."""
text32003;"""I'll come back for you, I promise."""
text32004;"""I said with anguish, cast a last glance at her, and walked outside."""
text32005;"""Everything was against me here."""
text32006;"""I couldn't take her with me by force, and could do nothing to oppose Ito."""
text32007;"""Which meant I had to retreat."""
text32008;"""At least for a time — to heal my wounds, restore my strength, and come up with a plan."""
text32009;"""But Himitsu's crying face seemed to have been burned onto the inside of my eyelids, and every time I closed my eyes, it haunted me."""
text32010;"""Beaten, humiliated, and desperate, I was barely forcing myself to drag my feet."""
text32011;"""My back felt like it was pierced by thousands of little needles every time I moved."""
text32012;"""I leaned against a light a couple hundred meters from my house."""
text32013;"""Fucking Japs!"""
text32014;"""I hissed in Russian."""
text32015;"""An old lady looked at me with distrust."""
text32016;"""It was the same look my classmates had given me after I fought with Catherine at school."""
text32017;"""What was holding me here, in this country?"""
text32018;"""Even the KGB — it was more of mine, of my homeland."""
text32019;"""Surprisingly, having lived in Japan for ten years, I felt no more Japanese than when I had come here as a little child."""
text32020;"""I got used to the country — yes, but the animal that is a human being can get used to anything."""
text32021;"""However, \""getting used to\"" and \""accepting\"" something are not one and the same!"""
text32022;"""I managed to massage my back a bit, and started thinking about what to do next."""
text32023;"""I definitely couldn't go home — someone was there."""
text32024;"""And if it was Mrs Winters, I didn't have the things she was looking for."""
text32025;"""So I had only one destination left — Kyosuke's place again."""
text32026;"""I had read somewhere that real friendship does not come easily – it requires continuous effort."""
text32027;"""That would mean I was really lucky to have him."""
text32028;"""Hello."""
text32029;"""I called Kyosuke from the nearest telephone box."""
text32030;"""Hi, it's me. I need a place to stay for the night."""
text32031;"""He didn't reply right away, clearly thinking about something."""
text32032;"""Okay."""
text32033;"""Thanks, I'll be there in half an hour."""
text32034;"""…"""
text32035;"""Precisely thirty minutes later I was lying spread out like a starfish in the middle of his room."""
text32036;"""Do you have an ointment for bruises?"""
text32037;"""What happened to you?"""
text32038;"""Hit my back."""
text32039;"""You hit it — or did someone else?"""
text32040;"""What's the difference? Won't hurt any less either way."""
text32041;"""I'll look for something."""
text32042;"""He walked out of the room and I started to contemplate his truly tremendous collection of manga."""
text32043;"""Some of the names looked familiar, while others meant nothing to me."""
text32044;"""Kyosuke met me without much enthusiasm, I'd even say coldly."""
text32045;"""Apparently he was tired of me constantly omitting and concealing things. If kept at it, next time I'd probably have to sleep on the street..."""
text32046;"""I covered my back with a double layer of ointment, and soon felt much better."""
text32047;"""Often it's enough to just feel better – and then you're happy."""
text32048;"""It happens after hangover as well as after disease."""
text32049;"""Oof, that was a nightmare…"""
text32050;"""Nick, are you going to tell me what's happening with you?"""
text32051;"""He sat behind the table and gave me a demanding look."""
text32052;"""The situation is getting worse."""
text32053;"""I began carefully."""
text32054;"""Himitsu's father and Catherine's mother are involved."""
text32055;"""Himitsu-chan...? What kind of nonsense is that?"""
text32056;"""I wish it was! He works for Japanese intelligence and had been spying on my parents. And now — on me."""
text32057;"""A nice inheritance…"""
text32058;"""I smirked."""
text32059;"""And Catherine's mother needs some documents from me that I don't have."""
text32060;"""He didn't need to know about the papers Ichinose had handed over to me."""
text32061;"""So, that's it… Everyone is demanding something from me, and nobody cares what I want."""
text32062;"""What are you going to do?"""
text32063;"""Well, first…"""
text32064;"""I closed my eyes and took a deep breath, as if trying to ventilate my head."""
text32065;"""I need to get Himitsu out of that house."""
text32066;"""Are you sure that's the right decision?"""
text32067;"""Kyosuke looked unusually serious."""
text32068;"""I'm not saying she's better off in there, but she'll at least be safer!"""
text32069;"""Safer with the person who used his own daughter as bait?"""
text32070;"""He lowered his eyes and didn't reply."""
text32071;"""Maybe there was some truth to his words, but I'd already gone too far to stop and retreat."""
text32072;"""Most likely, it was beyond my power at the moment to provide Himitsu with the life she deserved."""
text32073;"""But would it really be better for her to remain at the mercy of a person like Ito?"""
text32074;"""Occasionally I considered myself a sociopath, but then what did that make him?"""
text32075;"""Neglecting some social rules, I, at least, honored family ties and put love above abstract national interests."""
text32076;"""He's already proven that no one can feel safe around him!"""
text32077;"""Nick, even if it works out, have you even thought about what comes next? Where are you going to live? And how?"""
text32078;"""I prefer to handle problems as they come."""
text32079;"""A flicker of annoyance crossed Kyosuke's face, <seq kyo_normal>but he didn't say anything."""
text32080;"""Look, I'm grateful! I really am! For everything! And not only for this, but for all the years of our friendship…"""
text32081;"""I'm not really good at giving speeches. You know what I mean."""
text32082;"""My voice indeed sounded unnatural."""
text32083;"""And?"""
text32084;"""What?"""
text32085;"""After this speech you're definitely going to ask me for something."""
text32086;"""I let all the air out of my lungs."""
text32087;"""Yeah, I could use money. As much as you can give. I will… give it back… one day."""
text32088;"""Damn, we live in an age of advanced capitalism and yet can't buy the most important things. Happiness, love, health, even freedom."""
text32089;"""Maybe it's a matter of price?"""
text32090;"""How much would you give for Himitsu-chan's life?"""
text32091;"""He asked without a hint of irony and squinted."""
text32092;"""You don't have that much."""
text32093;"""Right you are."""
text32094;"""Kyosuke replied good-naturedly, stood up, grunting, removed a few volumes of manga from the upper shelf, and took out a small plastic bag from the stash."""
text32095;"""That's all I have."""
text32096;"""He handed it to me."""
text32097;"""I slowly counted the money – around <note=note154>a hundred thousand yen</note>."""
text32098;"""Not that bad for the first while — it would even be enough to rent a six tatami room somewhere far from Tokyo."""
text32099;"""I owe you for life!"""
text32100;"""Come on now…"""
text32101;"""He got embarrassed."""
text32102;"""We may not see each other again…"""
text32103;"""My friend even sobbed, but I continued right away so as to not catch his sentimentality."""
text32104;"""I <i>must</i> take Himitsu away from there!"""
text32105;"""Kyosuke didn't reply for a while, but eventually smiled and said:"""
text32106;"""Just when my mom was excited we were planning a <i>brainstorm</i> for our studies."""
text32107;"""<i>Brainstorm</i>, got it?"""
text32108;"""He leaned on the table and gave me one of those terrible grins of his, clearly expecting I'd appreciate his resourcefulness."""
text32109;"""A <i>brainstorm</i>! Got it…"""
text32110;"""…"""
text32111;"""I couldn't remember the last time I had waited for night to come with such anticipation."""
text32112;"""In order to pass time, I actually did homework with him, and again noticed how bad my friend was at his studies."""
text32113;"""\""He that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow\""…"""
text32114;"""Alright, I gotta go."""
text32115;"""Good luck!"""
text32116;"""I'll need it!"""
text32117;"""…"""
text32118;"""Neighbors used to tell us that merely ten or twenty years ago nobody would lock the doors of their houses in our district."""
text32119;"""They were most likely making it up, but the fences that separated the plots of land served a decorative purpose if any, and the gates were indeed often left open."""
text32120;"""Well, this wasn't the most criminogenic of Tokyo's districts!"""
text32121;"""I watched Himitsu's house from behind the corner for a while, but noticed no movement."""
text32122;"""Maybe the KGB and the Corporation were keeping my house under surveillance, but why would they be spying on Ito?"""
text32123;"""I turned up the collar of the jacket that I had providently borrowed from Kyosuke and started to slowly walk towards the house."""
text32124;"""A cap with an emblem of a baseball team and a jacket that was clearly too big for me – could I have chosen a more idiotic outfit?"""
text32125;"""However, this disproportional image of a city doofus was exactly the thing that was making me feel somewhat confident."""
text32126;"""Keeping my head low, I quickly darted to Himitsu's yard, walked around the house, and hid in the garden."""
text32127;"""When we were little, she used to get out of her room by climbing down the drain pipe and jumping off of the shed."""
text32128;"""I grabbed a pebble from the ground and threw it at the window."""
text32129;"""It made a dull thud – just enough for Himitsu to hear."""
text32130;"""After some time, she looked out the window."""
text32131;"""I waved my hands, but Himitsu just turned her head back and forth and closed the curtains."""
text32132;"""So I had to throw a larger rock…"""
text32133;"""Himitsu...!"""
text32134;"""If only it was possible to shout in a whisper…"""
text32135;"""Finally, she noticed me."""
text32136;"""Niko…"""
text32137;"""I put my finger to my lips and hissed:"""
text32138;"""Shhh! Shhh!"""
text32139;"""Himitsu understood and went quiet."""
text32140;"""I waved my hand, indicating that she should get down."""
text32141;"""She hesitated for a bit, but then arduously climbed out the window and wrapped her arms around the pipe as if it were a lifeline."""
text32142;"""I instantly felt that something was off, and I was right: Himitsu tried to climb down the pipe, but immediately fell off…"""
text32143;"""I prudently came closer and caught her in my arms."""
text32144;"""I wouldn't say it was easy, but Himitsu probably weighed no more than fifty kilograms, so I managed to hold her without falling to the grass."""
text32145;"""Sorry…"""
text32146;"""She said silently when she came to her senses."""
text32147;"""It used to be easier."""
text32148;"""I'd think so."""
text32149;"""I put Himitsu to the ground."""
text32150;"""Your dad?"""
text32151;"""He fell asleep in front of the TV."""
text32152;"""Are you sure?"""
text32153;"""I am!"""
text32154;"""She pouted."""
text32155;"""Alright, we need to go!"""
text32156;"""Where?"""
text32157;"""Somewhere far away from here."""
text32158;"""Niko-kun, I can't…"""
text32159;"""Himitsu lowered her eyes apologetically."""
text32160;"""What now?!"""
text32161;"""Where would we go? It's silly and childish!"""
text32162;"""So you think that staying here is very smart? Have you already forgotten what <i>he</i> did this afternoon?"""
text32163;"""I understand and I'm not condoning it, but… We should find another solution. Maybe we could talk…"""
text32164;"""Talk?!"""
text32165;"""I almost shouted."""
text32166;"""I tried! That's why I came to you today! Because…"""
text32167;"""Ah, screw it!"""
text32168;"""Because Catherine's mother had been waiting for me at home, and she threatened me!"""
text32169;"""Her again...?"""
text32170;"""Himitsu frowned."""
text32171;"""It's not about Catherine, it's about her mother! She, as you know, is supposed to be an American diplomat, but in reality…"""
text32172;"""I don't know who she really is! In any case, she wants documents that I don't have."""
text32173;"""And it doesn't even matter what she needs! What matters is that I was in real danger and I came to your father, because I had no one else to turn to… And you know what happened next!"""
text32174;"""And after all that you're suggesting I talk to him <i>again</i>?"""
text32175;"""She wasn't replying, just methodically picking at the earth with the tip of her shoe."""
text32176;"""Come on, Himitsu, this isn't a joke!"""
text32177;"""Who knows what'll get into his head next...?"""
text32178;"""Niko-kun, he's still my father… You don't think that…"""
text32179;"""I don't know what to think!"""
text32180;"""Fine."""
text32181;"""She raised her tearful eyes to me."""
text32182;"""I'll talk to him. And if it doesn't work out…"""
text32183;"""But…"""
text32184;"""Don't worry, everything will be alright."""
text32185;"""She stood on her tiptoes and kissed me."""
text32186;"""My intense desire to prove that I was right evaporated at once."""
text32187;"""Tomorrow. I'll drop by."""
text32188;"""I'm staying at Kyosuke's place – it's too dangerous at home."""
text32189;"""Then I'll call him."""
text32190;"""I looked at Himitsu closely but just couldn't figure out what to do."""
text32191;"""But she looked unexpectedly confident, and her big, green, unblinking eyes seemed to be looking right into my soul."""
text32192;"""Do you know his phone number?"""
text32193;"""I finally gave up and sighed."""
text32194;"""Of course!"""
text32195;"""Well then…"""
text32196;"""I wanted to say \""be careful\"", but decided that it wouldn't sound appropriate in this situation."""
text32197;"""After all, she was home."""
text32198;"""…"""
text32199;"""I returned to Kyosuke's place after midnight."""
text32200;"""His mom looked sleepy and not too happy when opening the door, but seemed to believe that I'd just forgotten an important notebook at home."""
text32201;"""Kyosuke wasn't really surprised by my return, but didn't comment on it, only saying a standard \""I told you\""."""
text32202;"""The hard futon, the snoring right above my ear, and my own thoughts didn't let me fall asleep for a long while."""

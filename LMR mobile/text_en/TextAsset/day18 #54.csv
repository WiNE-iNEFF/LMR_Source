text17880;"""In my dream, there was an endless sapient ocean, its intellect as far removed from a human's as could be."""
text17881;"""Love, hatred, pride, power, money, revenge, family, primal instincts — none of that mattered to it."""
text17882;"""I couldn't understand what drove its existence. It was fundamentally impossible for me to comprehend what it thought about me…"""
text17883;"""The alarm clock was an unpleasant surprise for me — I didn't even remember setting it."""
text17884;"""But it was time to get up and prepare for school."""
text17885;"""There were several reasons to attend class: first, I still had to talk to Kagome since I hadn't yesterday."""
text17886;"""Second, as paranoid as it might have sounded, the police could find my absence suspicious."""
text17887;"""Maybe Kagome would be more reasonable today."""
text17888;"""…"""
text17889;"""But she wasn't in the classroom, and before the start of the first class the principal walked in and announced an all-school assembly."""
text17890;"""I've seen this somewhere before."""
text17891;"""Kyosuke said without a hint of sarcasm."""
text17892;"""A shiver ran down my spine, the feeling of some unclear danger seemed to have paralyzed my whole body."""
text17893;"""Nick, let's go?"""
text17894;"""Yeah, sure."""
text17895;"""I said reluctantly and stood up."""
text17896;"""The strange podium was in the yard yet again. Kiyama-sensei was standing on it and meeting the students with a stern glare as they left the school building."""
text17897;"""Kyosuke and I stood in more or less the middle of the crowd."""
text17898;"""Michael joined us shortly, but Kagome was nowhere be seen."""
text17899;"""Don't you think it's weird that Iwamura hasn't come today?"""
text17900;"""Would you be quiet?"""
text17901;"""I waved him away."""
text17902;"""The principal looked over the students one last time, closed his eyes, and sighed in an overly dramatic manner."""
text17903;"""As you all know, a terrible tragedy took place several days ago. Eight students of our school met a brutal death at the hands of an unknown murderer."""
text17904;"""I promised you that we would find the perpetrator, and we — with the help of the police, of course — have!"""
text17905;"""His speech sounded as dramatic as always, which seemed particularly inappropriate for the situation."""
text17906;"""It's hard for me to say this, but the perpetrator turned out to be one of the students of our school."""
text17907;"""He stopped, as if expecting a reaction, but everyone was listening quietly, looking at the old principal with silent attention."""
text17908;"""The reason for this monstrous deed was simple personal animosity…"""
text17909;"""Come on, spit it out!"""
text17910;"""Kyosuke grumbled next to me."""
text17911;"""I couldn't say a word though — I knew what Kiyama was going to say anyway."""
text17912;"""…Iwamura Kagome, a senior student of our school. Right now she is in custody, and the police are doing their work."""
text17913;"""Kagome? <w>So it was her, after all…"""
text17914;"""But I just couldn't believe it, remembering how Kagome had almost burst into tears yesterday."""
text17915;"""But I just couldn't believe it."""
text17916;"""It happens sometimes: you know something is going to happen, prepare yourself for it, but when it finally arrives you still don't expect it."""
text17917;"""I could accuse Kagome all I wanted, believe she was the murderer deep inside and reinforce that opinion with arguments of varying legitimacy..."""
text17918;"""But I was completely unprepared for that to be the truth!"""
text17919;"""I understand that it must be shocking for all of you! It was a great shock to me!"""
text17920;"""Sure thing!"""
text17921;"""Kyosuke scoffed."""
text17922;"""Well Nick, what did I tell you?"""
text17923;"""He looked at me with eyes full of anticipation."""
text17924;"""It's not a fucking quiz show! You're not getting a prize for the right answer!"""
text17925;"""I hissed at him."""
text17926;"""And there isn't a <i>right</i> answer here!"""
text17927;"""I can't believe Iwamura is capable of… I mean — <i>physically capable</i> of killing eight people at once!"""
text17928;"""Meanwhile, the principal continued:"""
text17929;"""We couldn't imagine that such a monster was hiding among us, among our children. We couldn't know…"""
text17930;"""Kiyama-sensei's primary goal seemed to be protection of the school's image."""
text17931;"""I assure you, if we had ever had any suspicions…"""
text17932;"""Japanese are generally good at hindsight."""
text17933;"""I felt a sharp lack of air."""
text17934;"""I need to go."""
text17935;"""I said to Kyosuke and carefully pushed my way through the crowd to the school gate."""
text17936;"""I felt better on the street, with fewer people around and far enough away that the principal's rancid speech couldn't reach me."""
text17937;"""I took several deep breaths, leaning my hand against the school gate."""
text17938;"""I told you."""
text17939;"""A familiar voice came from behind me."""
text17940;"""Don't scare me like that!"""
text17941;"""I jumped up and spun around."""
text17942;"""Ellie stood next to me with a gloomy expression on her face."""
text17943;"""I'm not gloating, not at all, but…"""
text17944;"""I warned you from the very beginning."""
text17945;"""I hope you aren't about to say that Iwamura was accused because of you?"""
text17946;"""Barely concealed notes of anger crept into my voice."""
text17947;"""We've been through that, too… You accuse my grandpa of everything."""
text17948;"""So it's not his fault now?"""
text17949;"""I… haven't told him anything else."""
text17950;"""But her tone lacked confidence."""
text17951;"""Glad to hear that."""
text17952;"""I gave her a sour smirk and looked at the gathering in the school yard."""
text17953;"""The principal kept talking, but I couldn't hear exactly what he was saying. <w>To hell with him anyway."""
text17954;"""Nick, I'm serious! This is better for everyone!"""
text17955;"""But not for Iwamura…"""
text17956;"""Do you still think she's innocent?"""
text17957;"""…"""
text17958;"""You don't trust the police?"""
text17959;"""Yes, I didn't have much reason to trust them."""
text17960;"""Especially considering the interrogation Kagome and I had been subjected to after visiting Kobayashi Jun."""
text17961;"""What the hell was that?!"""
text17962;"""There is no crime a capitalist would not commit for 300% profit."""
text17963;"""It's a good thing we don't have Marxism-Leninism here!"""
text17964;"""I was a bit surprised by the depth of Ellie's knowledge but still couldn't help myself:"""
text17965;"""It wasn't Marx who said that."""
text17966;"""What does it matter?!"""
text17967;"""She grew angry and stomped her foot, but quickly caught herself."""
text17968;"""Sorry… I understand it's not easy for you. And I…"""
text17969;"""I shouldn't have said all that! Sorry!"""
text17970;"""She blurted out, turned around, and ran back to school."""
text17971;"""Well, at least now I knew it wasn't Ellie's fault."""
text17972;"""Although if Kobayashi Jun was involved in the arrest, he probably wouldn't tell his granddaughter."""
text17973;"""I calmed down a bit and went back to the yard."""
text17974;"""Just in time for the end of Kiyama-sensei's fiery speech."""
text17975;"""For a while, the students lingered, exchanging confused glances."""
text17976;"""Almost all of them were quiet, only a few whispering to each other."""
text17977;"""I walked to Kyosuke and carefully put my hand on his shoulder."""
text17978;"""Have I missed much?"""
text17979;"""You can watch the tape."""
text17980;"""He replied sarcastically."""
text17981;"""I wouldn't even be surprised if he actually invited a TV crew…"""
text17982;"""But I couldn't get rid of the thought that Kagome had brought it upon herself."""
text17983;"""What was she doing at the crime scene?"""
text17984;"""What if the three of us weren't alone there after all and it wasn't just the ghosts of the night watching us?"""
text17985;"""During lunch, Kyosuke, Michael, and I gathered in the cafeteria — not so much to eat as to discuss everything that'd happened."""
text17986;"""As tired as I was of all this talking, I knew the conversation was unavoidable."""
text17987;"""I don't want to repeat myself, but I knew from the very first day that Iwamura was the murderer!"""
text17988;"""Let's not go <i>there</i>, alright?"""
text17989;"""What, isn't it true? Tell him, Mike!"""
text17990;"""No, it's not."""
text17991;"""Michael replied readily."""
text17992;"""You two are always like this…"""
text17993;"""Kyosuke pouted and turned away."""
text17994;"""I still don't believe that Iwamura is guilty. I don't know what evidence the police have, but it can't be true, because it just can't!"""
text17995;"""Think about it: eight people! At once! Did she shoot them with a machine gun?"""
text17996;"""Besides, all of them had to have ended up there that night somehow. Against their will, probably."""
text17997;"""Nick, we aren't the ones you have to convince."""
text17998;"""I know that…"""
text17999;"""I looked around — there were even fewer people in the cafeteria than the last time."""
text18000;"""It's interesting how an event that doesn't involve you directly can change your behavior."""
text18001;"""Were they really afraid that Kagome the maniac would jump at them with a knife right in the school?"""
text18002;"""Still, for some reason all of them decided that hunger was currently low on their list of priorities."""
text18003;"""The numerous empty tables were the best evidence for my theory."""
text18004;"""I still don't understand, why are you protecting her like this?"""
text18005;"""Because…"""
text18006;"""I couldn't find the answer. <w>Not for Kyosuke nor for myself."""
text18007;"""For the first time, I felt there was no way back."""
text18008;"""Whether Kagome was really guilty or not, framed or not, whether Kobayashi Jun was involved or not — none of it mattered since nothing could be changed."""
text18009;"""There was no way for me to help her."""
text18010;"""Because I really believe that she's not guilty."""
text18011;"""I said quietly."""
text18012;"""Eh, what? I can't hear you!"""
text18013;"""Kyosuke exclaimed, leaned onto the table, and demonstratively put his hand against his ear."""
text18014;"""And immediately received a stinging slap on it courtesy of me."""
text18015;"""Calm down already!"""
text18016;"""Ouch, that hurts!"""
text18017;"""In any case, we can't do anything now."""
text18018;"""Michael said calmly, as if reading my mind."""
text18019;"""He probably just wanted to support me in his own way, since I doubted he cared about Kagome's fate."""
text18020;"""Thank you."""
text18021;"""Michael just nodded lightly in response."""
text18022;"""No, I mean, she could have accomplices."""
text18023;"""Triads, for example…"""
text18024;"""Kyosuke's imagination had gone so wild he'd started believing his own nonsense."""
text18025;"""Have you ever thought that Iwamura might have some Chinese roots? If you look at her carefully…"""
text18026;"""Kyosuke, enough."""
text18027;"""But by now he had stopped listening altogether."""
text18028;"""On the other hand, the yakuza option…"""
text18029;"""I threw a piece of broccoli precisely in the center in Kyosuke's ramen bowl, several drops of stock splashing onto his clothes."""
text18030;"""It took him several seconds to process what happened, but he suddenly snapped out of it, squinting slyly."""
text18031;"""Take that!"""
text18032;"""Then he threw a chopstick at me."""
text18033;"""I dodged, and the chopstick hit the back of the girl sitting behind us."""
text18034;"""That girl turned out to be Saya-chan. <w>Luckily, Himitsu wasn't around."""
text18035;"""Suzuhara-san…"""
text18036;"""Kyosuke prattled."""
text18037;"""Saya turned around, looked at him angrily, but said nothing."""
text18038;"""Sorry…"""
text18039;"""My chubby friend looked a little too scared."""
text18040;"""How did he even know her surname?"""
text18041;"""(Although I was more surprised that she had one: to me she was always just <i>Saya-chan</i>.)"""
text18042;"""Do you two know each other?"""
text18043;"""Us? No, but…"""
text18044;"""Kyosuke was noticeably sweating."""
text18045;"""Don't tell me you've fallen for her!"""
text18046;"""I laughed way louder than I should've."""
text18047;"""Quiet, you!"""
text18048;"""Oh, I can't!"""
text18049;"""Now the rest of the students were looking at us, not just Saya-chan."""
text18050;"""Look who's talking! I'm not judging you for Iwamura!"""
text18051;"""Hardly the same thing."""
text18052;"""I finally calmed down a bit."""
text18053;"""Are you sure about that?"""
text18054;"""…"""
text18055;"""Sure, Saya-chan wasn't the prettiest girl in the world and didn't have the nicest personality, but at least she wasn't suspected of committing a mass murder."""
text18056;"""I felt ashamed."""
text18057;"""You know what, whatever!"""
text18058;"""I crossed my arms over my chest and turned away."""
text18059;"""Sorry. I didn't know…"""
text18060;"""I looked at Michael — he didn't seem to be interested in our conversation in the slightest."""
text18061;"""Yeah, and why did you think that I… that I…"""
text18062;"""Being at a loss for words wasn't like him either."""
text18063;"""Nevermind."""
text18064;"""I said firmly and got back to the food."""
text18065;"""…"""
text18066;"""The school day ended pretty quickly."""
text18067;"""My classmates were unusually quiet, a dismal expression stuck on most of their faces."""
text18068;"""Most likely, not a single one of them even considered that Kagome could be innocent."""
text18069;"""It's not hard to imagine an outcast who you wouldn't even sit next to have done something terrible. <w>Nobody would even be surprised."""
text18070;"""For many, having some sort of physical or mental defect, even just being shy or lacking social skills, is an aggravating circumstance in and of itself."""
text18071;"""What must it be like to feel that the entire world is against you?"""
text18072;"""…"""
text18073;"""On my way home, I was desperately trying not to look at the people on the street."""
text18074;"""I felt like they were all sneering down at me, at the very least, maybe even prepared to attack me."""
text18075;"""What if deep inside everyone thought I was an outcast, too?"""
text18076;"""How was I fundamentally any different from Kagome?"""
text18077;"""By having a couple of friends and knowing Ellie?"""
text18078;"""Our personalities were probably pretty similar from the outside."""
text18079;"""We'd both suffered at the hands of Kobayashi Corporation."""
text18080;"""We both had a very vague idea of and prospects for the future."""
text18081;"""We both were unhappy with our lives."""
text18082;"""When I thought about how I could've warned her yesterday but hadn't, I felt sick."""
text18083;"""But what else could I do?"""
text18084;"""I had warned her yesterday but it didn't change a thing."""
text18085;"""Today my old house seemed to be looking down on me too."""
text18086;"""If my parents had been alive, they would have renovated it by now or at least kept the yard clean."""
text18087;"""I couldn't say I didn't care about it, but worrying about the inner and outer appearance of my home was somewhere around the bottom of my list of priorities."""
text18088;"""When I opened the door, I immediately felt something was wrong."""
text18089;"""But I had nowhere to retreat to."""
text18090;"""Indeed — Irina was sitting in the kitchen, idly flipping through the pages of a newspaper."""
text18091;"""Welcome. Sorry for coming in without an invitation."""
text18092;"""I said and, paying no attention to her, walked to the fridge."""
text18093;"""Good to see you, Nikolai."""
text18094;"""This is <i>my</i> house, actually."""
text18095;"""Of course, I should've been more careful around her, but these regular visits were starting to get on my nerves."""
text18096;"""I hope you've had enough time to think about our offer."""
text18097;"""I haven't, to be honest."""
text18098;"""Oh, and what's been keeping you so busy? Music?"""
text18099;"""She smiled, but her eyes followed me with the attention of a predator."""
text18100;"""That too. And the murders at my school. Do you know anything about that?"""
text18101;"""I asked randomly, more to distract her from attacking me."""
text18102;"""Do I know anything about the murders…"""
text18103;"""She repeated thoughtfully, as if trying to grasp the meaning of what I'd just said."""
text18104;"""It seems the police just recently detained the suspect."""
text18105;"""Exactly. Iwamura Kagome. We were talking about her last time."""
text18106;"""And I think the two of you are in the same class."""
text18107;"""Stop playing dumb."""
text18108;"""The fake expression on Irina's face disappeared at once, giving place to cold concentration."""
text18109;"""Well yes, we framed her."""
text18110;"""But… why?"""
text18111;"""Out of surprise, I started back and bumped into the fridge."""
text18112;"""The boxes on top of it shook but didn't fall."""
text18113;"""She was sticking her nose everywhere and had become a nuisance to us."""
text18114;"""How could a simple Japanese schoolgirl became a nuisance to the all-mighty KGB?!"""
text18115;"""I exclaimed."""
text18116;"""Be quiet — the walls have ears."""
text18117;"""I thought they were yours."""
text18118;"""In another situation, Irina might have appreciated the joke, but today she apparently wasn't in the mood."""
text18119;"""I would've agreed with you under different circumstances, but Iwamura's father is hardly uninvolved in this whole affair."""
text18120;"""And if she hadn't bothered certain important people, she would be enjoying her freedom now."""
text18121;"""Then why not just kill her?"""
text18122;"""Indeed…"""
text18123;"""She replied as if returning the question to me."""
text18124;"""In any case, this will be a good lesson for you."""
text18125;"""Eight people! Don't you think that's too many for a <i>lesson</i>?"""
text18126;"""What did they do?!"""
text18127;"""Collateral damage."""
text18128;"""Right, why didn't I guess that right away?"""
text18129;"""Alright, Nikolai, I'm not in the mood to chat with you."""
text18130;"""Weirdly enough, Irina rarely spoke about herself, it was usually all <i>we</i> and <i>us</i>."""
text18131;"""Then why are <note=note44>you… you</note> here?"""
text18132;"""I still couldn't figure out how to address her."""
text18133;"""I think I told you last time — it's good you've grown close with Kobayashi Jun's granddaughter."""
text18134;"""Is your relationship… developing?"""
text18135;"""She relaxed her shoulders, leaned back, fixed her hair, and smiled."""
text18136;"""It was amazing how in a fraction of a second this woman could turn from KGB Major Irina Mostovaya to the silly employee of the French embassy Irene Dupont, appreciator of good drinks and handsome boys."""
text18137;"""We aren't… in a relationship. That's not my opinion, it's a fact."""
text18138;"""I replied reluctantly."""
text18139;"""It's very strange to play in a band together and have no relationship <i>at all</i>."""
text18140;"""You sure know a lot."""
text18141;"""We know plenty. But not enough. And you'll help us fix that."""
text18142;"""How?"""
text18143;"""For a while, Irina kept looking at me like I'd said something unbelievably stupid."""
text18144;"""We've been trying to infiltrate Kobayashi Jun's inner circle for some time now, but he's very cautious."""
text18145;"""And that's where you take the stage!"""
text18146;"""In a couple days, there will be a charity ball at Kobayashi's estate — and I need you to be there."""
text18147;"""Is it so difficult to get an invitation for a <i>charity</i> ball? Just make a donation."""
text18148;"""To be honest, I knew nothing about that sort of thing and was making an assumption based on books and movies I'd seen."""
text18149;"""We aren't in the US or even Europe. Every guest's background is checked thoroughly by the Corporation's security service."""
text18150;"""And of course, they'll let me in!"""
text18151;"""I smirked sarcastically."""
text18152;"""They will — if you come as the beau of the host's granddaughter."""
text18153;"""Married me over my head huh?"""
text18154;"""I'm glad you're having fun — positivity increases the chance of success. Just don't go too far."""
text18155;"""Let's say I get into the estate, what next?"""
text18156;"""Next… <seq ir_legs1>well…"""
text18157;"""She went through her bag, took out a small device, and carefully handed it over to me."""
text18158;"""It looked like a miniature camera."""
text18159;"""You don't need to know the details, but we have reliable intel that Kobayashi Jun recently made a secret deal with the Americans."""
text18160;"""He should have some papers concerning this deal in his office. Your task is to find and carefully photograph them."""
text18161;"""Again, even if I somehow manage to sneak into his office — how would I know what exactly I'm supposed to look for? He could have a mountain of documents in there."""
text18162;"""Irina scoffed and took a square instant photo out of her bag, depicting a paper sheet with a logo of Earth surrounded by several circles."""
text18163;"""There clearly used to be text under the logo, but it was painted over with a black marker."""
text18164;"""Look for this logo."""
text18165;"""What does it mean?"""
text18166;"""It means that you know more than enough to complete the mission! Except…"""
text18167;"""After the photo, she took out a sheet with the layout of the Kobayashi estate."""
text18168;"""It was clearly made by hand, but extremely carefully."""
text18169;"""You need to get into this room!"""
text18170;"""She circled the right place with a red marker."""
text18171;"""What happens if I fail?"""
text18172;"""My voice sounded like it belonged to someone else — cold and distant."""
text18173;"""Don't you already know?"""
text18174;"""I mean — what if I can't find the documents?"""
text18175;"""Irina once again returned to the image of perfect innocence."""
text18176;"""Then let's hope that your and Kobayashi Ellie-san's love ends up being more than juvenile infatuation."""
text18177;"""The words made me feel disgusted, even a strange sour taste appeared in my mouth."""
text18178;"""So I'm just expendable to you?"""
text18179;"""Nikolai, what are you saying…"""
text18180;"""And my death would be written off as <i>collateral damage</i>?"""
text18181;"""You know, I'm tired of having these soul-searching conversations with you and trying to convince you of the importance of what we're doing."""
text18182;"""I wish I could know <i>what</i> we're doing exactly…"""
text18183;"""I remarked, but Irina continued without paying attention to it:"""
text18184;"""You don't have much choice. You either help us and we help you…"""
text18185;"""Did you give the same offer to Iwamura? Did she reject it?"""
text18186;"""You aren't her. And you should be grateful for that!"""
text18187;"""So… you either help us or you're left alone with your problems."""
text18188;"""I haven't seen much help from you so far."""
text18189;"""If you manage this, we'll be able to bring you to the USSR."""
text18190;"""Unless you have something that's keeping you here."""
text18191;"""Irina suddenly stood up in one quick motion, grabbed the photo from the table, and put it in her bag."""
text18192;"""You understand. Until next time."""
text18193;"""I was left with the plan of Kobayashi's estate."""
text18194;"""…"""
text18195;"""The rest of the day was spent in pointless rumination."""
text18196;"""It wasn't even about trusting Irina and her promise or not, but about whether I wanted to return to my homeland."""
text18197;"""Was anything keeping me in Japan?"""
text18198;"""My relationship with Himitsu was completely ruined, and, worse than that, deep inside I believed it was for the better."""
text18199;"""Yes, there was a prospect of a mind-blowing music career — but how real was that fantasy?"""
text18200;"""Ellie would graduate in half a year — and what would happen to Z FEEL-Z?"""
text18201;"""She could repeat all she wanted that she wished to make her own choices, but not everything in a teenager's life bends to their will."""
text18202;"""Directly or indirectly, our choices are defined by our parents and loved ones."""
text18203;"""That influence is even more important in Japan."""
text18204;"""And, I'd imagine, even more so in the Kobayashi family."""
text18205;"""I was walking from one room to another when I suddenly noticed the smell."""
text18206;"""It's interesting how each house has its own palette of aromas incomparable to anything."""
text18207;"""The smell of dust, wood, paper turned yellow, of old clothes, moth-eaten and languishing in a wardrobe, and the odor of soap, that seems to be the same everywhere, yet smells differently in each house."""
text18208;"""But <i>our</i> specific smell had almost disappeared in the year and a half that had passed since my parents' death."""
text18209;"""Soon enough, there wouldn't be anything left in this house but stench, dampness, and mold."""
text18210;"""So I had to decide who I was afraid of more — the KGB or Kobayashi Corporation."""
text18211;"""Despite all the power the Corporation possessed, it hadn't manifested itself in any way so far."""
text18212;"""There was a threat to be found in Kobayashi Jun's warnings, Kagemaru's frightening facial expressions, and Ichinose's words."""
text18213;"""Meanwhile, Irina regularly visited me in person, was very talkative, and presented a vivid picture of what would happen if I refused to work with her."""
text18214;"""And after what they did to Ellie's <i>friends</i>…"""
text18215;"""And then a thought suddenly came to mind."""

text18218;"""Especially after the police detained her."""
text18219;"""Given that the Japanese justice system isn't known for its acquittals, I didn't have much chance of seeing Kagome outside the walls of a prison."""

text18224;"""And then I could make things up as I go — I could just lie and say I had looked for the documents and didn't find any."""
text18225;"""Irina wouldn't have any way to tell whether I was telling the truth or not, right…?"""
text18226;"""Any decision is better than none — and with that thought, I went to sleep."""

text33506;"""That's how my story ended…"""
text33507;"""...are the words a writer would have put at the end of a novel about the life of Nikolai Anokhin."""
text33508;"""Indeed, in the real world, unlike in books, most stories don't have a happy ending — the blind sequence of accidents knows no compassion, love, or sympathy."""
text33509;"""The death of one human, thousands, or millions on the scale of even our backwater planet is just a matter of chance, no more significant than winning the lottery."""
text33510;"""I made my bet — and I lost. I trusted my compatriots — and was deceived by them..."""
text33511;"""Cold sweat burned my back, and the total darkness I was in numbed my sense of reality — it felt like I had already died, and only an intense headache proved me wrong."""
text33512;"""It was hard to say how many hours I spent unconscious."""
text33513;"""The room where I was kept resembled a closet more than anything, with no windows and a single metal door that let no light through."""
text33514;"""Hey…"""
text33515;"""I wheezed, to which my entire body responded with pain."""
text33516;"""Himitsu… <w>We had been separated, and I was left alive."""
text33517;"""So they still needed me for something."""
text33518;"""Memories began to return, each a burst of acute pain in the back of my head."""
text33519;"""It seemed that after they had stunned me, one of them said something… <w>But what exactly?"""
text33520;"""I didn't remember the face of the attacker, he may very well have been wearing a mask."""
text33521;"""There was the blow, and then the curtains dropped and darkness came. <w>Like in a theater."""
text33522;"""I was going through that moment again and again in my head."""
text33523;"""The blow and the words in the unfamiliar language."""
text33524;"""The blow and…"""
text33525;"""Drive… <i>Drive</i>…"""
text33526;"""<i>Drive</i>!"""
text33527;"""In English!"""
text33528;"""Then the door opened, and the entire room was drowned in bright light. It reached into every corner and seemed to be filling me from inside."""
text33529;"""I squeezed my eyes so hard they hurt — but there was no escaping it."""
text33530;"""Somebody grabbed me by the arm and pulled me back on my feet with one strong jerk."""
text33531;"""Then I was led through long, narrow corridors."""
text33532;"""Finally, I was sat on a chair, uncuffed, and heard the sound of a door closing behind my back."""
text33533;"""I wasn't alone in the space that resembled the interrogation room of a police station."""
text33534;"""My eyes were still blinded by white light, but it was as if I could feel the presence of someone in the corner, hidden in shadow, with my skin."""
text33535;"""Nikolai."""
text33536;"""Soon Catherine's mother herself appeared in the light."""
text33537;"""It is a pity to meet in these circumstances."""
text33538;"""She sat behind the table across from me."""
text33539;"""Himitsu…"""
text33540;"""My voice sounded hoarse and strained, as if it didn't belong to me."""
text33541;"""What have you done to her?"""
text33542;"""She's safe for now. What will happen next depends entirely on you."""
text33543;"""What about the Russians? I thought we got captured by them."""
text33544;"""If we had been late even by a minute, that would've been the case."""
text33545;"""She pulled a pack of cigarettes out of her pocket and shook it thoughtfully, as if choosing which to take."""
text33546;"""Perhaps if we had, you would've already been in Moscow instead of having this conversation. Tough luck."""
text33547;"""What do you need from me? I've already told you — I don't have any documents!"""
text33548;"""The reality of the situation started to get through to me more and more clearly, and with it came anger."""
text33549;"""I was willing to believe that last time, but Ito's daughter has fixed that unfortunate omission."""
text33550;"""What...?"""
text33551;"""You still don't to see the entire picture?"""
text33552;"""She laughed and finally lit the cigarette."""
text33553;"""Ito was just waiting for her return — and by lucky coincidence, she took with her the documents the Russians needed."""
text33554;"""They don't present any particular value or threat to us or the Japanese, but they do provide an opportunity to accuse the USSR of industrial espionage."""
text33555;"""You parents, unfortunately, left this world too early to play that role."""
text33556;"""How dare you…"""
text33557;"""I jumped up from the chair but the look she gave me made me quickly realize it wasn't even worth trying."""
text33558;"""So, the documents are in the KGB's hands. Now we only need to capture the traitor who finished the job his parents couldn't."""
text33559;"""Finally, all the pieces of the puzzle fit together."""
text33560;"""This was their plan from the very beginning!"""
text33561;"""From the very beginning, they'd been pushing me to cooperate with the KGB, setting everything up to leave me no choice but to agree to Irina's terms."""
text33562;"""There was only one piece that was still out of place…"""
text33563;"""If everything is as you say, what was all that shooting about? A bit too much noise for a secret operation."""
text33564;"""Apparently, Sheryl Winters wasn't overjoyed by the question."""
text33565;"""The Russians decided to eliminate the witnesses at the last moment."""
text33566;"""So they were the ones who started shooting?"""
text33567;"""Yes."""
text33568;"""How very convenient."""
text33569;"""Although I couldn't rule out the possibility that it was the truth."""
text33570;"""Alright. So what's next? Sounds like you need me alive — for the show trial."""
text33571;"""The son of Russian spies following in his dead parents' footsteps. I can already imagine the headlines!"""
text33572;"""I only had one thought in my head — I had to protect Himitsu. <w>At any cost."""
text33573;"""Let's say I do everything you want me to…"""
text33574;"""You aren't in a position to make demands."""
text33575;"""You won't make me talk by force either!"""
text33576;"""Depends on the cost of your silence."""
text33577;"""…"""
text33578;"""For instance, is your girlfriend's life a high enough price?"""
text33579;"""I only grit my teeth."""
text33580;"""They really did hold all the aces."""
text33581;"""Do everything like you're supposed to, and she'll live. Try to play your own tune, and both of you will be feeding the fish in Tokyo bay."""
text33582;"""How's that for straight talk!"""
text33583;"""Where are my guarantees?"""
text33584;"""Oh, sorry, I forgot them at home!"""
text33585;"""She said in a tone that immediately made it clear where Catherine got her sarcasm."""
text33586;"""Should I arrange for an official ceremony to deliver them to you?"""
text33587;"""Nikolai, you seem to be misunderstanding things again. I am not here to bargain with you, I'm explaining how things are going to be!"""
text33588;"""She leaned over the table and coldly looked me in the eyes."""
text33589;"""I wanted to ask about Kagome too, but there was a chance that she had nothing to do with it all, and I would just pointlessly expose her to danger."""
text33590;"""So, all this time Ito…"""
text33591;"""The Japanese are good at one thing — they're obedient and, if they're in the right place, don't ask questions."""
text33592;"""Has he really been using his daughter in cold blood?"""
text33593;"""How do you know if his daughter hasn't been following his instructions?"""
text33594;"""She squinted slyly and reminded me of Catherine again."""
text33595;"""If you're going to lie, at least make your lies believable."""
text33596;"""She smirked and leaned back in the chair."""
text33597;"""It's good to have a person you can trust so blindly."""
text33598;"""No way! <w>She wasn't going to make me doubt Himitsu!"""
text33599;"""I should've known that the Japanese hadn't engineered all this by themselves."""
text33600;"""The only thing we need from you now is your cooperation. You'll get ten years and, maybe, an early parole."""
text33601;"""And then we'll discuss your life from there on."""
text33602;"""This… Is this your way of bribing me?"""
text33603;"""Why so rude! Stimulating you is how I'd put it, preparing a place for you to come back to."""
text33604;"""On the one hand, the offer wasn't as bad as you might think."""
text33605;"""They'd leave Himitsu in peace and were even offering some possible help in the future."""
text33606;"""Of course, I had no reason to trust them, but Catherine's mother was right about one thing — I wasn't in a position to bargain."""
text33607;"""So, what do you say?"""
text33608;"""The temptation to accept her offer was too great."""
text33609;"""But there was still something stopping me."""
text33610;"""A hunch, you could say."""
text33611;"""Mrs Winters clearly wasn't telling the entire story — otherwise, why bother with me at all?"""
text33612;"""That meant that I had a choice, at least on paper, and I had to make it very carefully."""
text33613;"""Agree"""
text33614;"""Let's say I cooperate. What happens next?"""
text33615;"""I knew you would do the right thing."""
text33616;"""She smiled victoriously and stood up."""
text33617;"""Now I need some time to handle a few details. Wait for me here."""
text33618;"""She walked out of the room and locked the door."""
text33619;"""In her every movement and gesture, there was an unusual elegance."""
text33620;"""Sheryl Winters' looks alone killed any desire to defy her."""
text33621;"""I was left alone, the silence broken only by the fan pushing stuffy air around the room."""
text33622;"""Refuse"""
text33623;"""I'll take my chances. At the very least, I need some kind of guarantee."""
text33624;"""Sheryl Winters looked annoyed."""
text33625;"""You're making an enormous mistake, Nikolai! Remember that it's not just your fate that depends on you!"""
text33626;"""I understand. But I have no reason to believe you. At least let me see Himitsu first, and then we'll get back to this conversation."""
text33627;"""I was hoping you were smarter than this."""
text33628;"""She scoffed contemptuously, stood up, and walked out of the room, locking the door behind her."""
text33629;"""Catherine's mother was one of those women whose appearance alone inspires respect and even a certain awe."""
text33630;"""The silence left in her wake rang accusingly, as if scolding me for making the wrong choice."""
text33631;"""It felt like I'd done something wrong."""
text33632;"""As if I had been pulled out of the normal order of things."""
text33633;"""Nobody knew about my choice yet, nobody was condemning me for it, but I had already sentenced myself..."""
text33634;"""I really wanted to eat and drink something."""
text33635;"""Mrs Winters had only left ten minutes ago, but I already couldn't keep still, pacing around the tiny room."""
text33636;"""Did I do the right thing, was Himitsu safe now...?"""
text33637;"""The door squeaked quietly and opened almost without a sound."""
text33638;"""Finally!"""
text33639;"""I said pretty loudly and stood against the entrance."""
text33640;"""However, it wasn't Catherine's mother standing in the doorway, it was…"""
text33641;"""Ito!"""
text33642;"""Nikolai, we don't have time!"""
text33643;"""…"""
text33644;"""I couldn't say anything, so I just stood there staring at the face of my enemy."""
text33645;"""He looked extremely anxious, covered in sweat, his eyes gleaming feverishly."""
text33646;"""Later! I'll explain everything later! Right now we need to get you out of here before <i>she</i> comes back!"""
text33647;"""He stepped toward me but I moved back instinctually."""
text33648;"""Why did you refuse her offer?"""
text33649;"""…"""
text33650;"""How did he know that? <w>What was he doing there?"""
text33651;"""Do you have a better one?"""
text33652;"""I finally managed to squeeze out the words."""
text33653;"""I'm trying to help you, you idiot!"""
text33654;"""What about helping Himitsu...?"""
text33655;"""She's fine, she's already in a safe place."""
text33656;"""Everything turned upside down again — Mrs Winters had just told me Ito had been following their orders all along, and now he seemed to be going against her."""
text33657;"""Hurry up!"""
text33658;"""Where to?"""
text33659;"""I'll get you out of this building. Change your clothes."""
text33660;"""He took a blue jacket — like the ones mailmen wear — and a cap out of the bag he was holding."""
text33661;"""You can think later! Or do you think it's safer here?"""
text33662;"""Of course, I didn't want to remain in the hands of the CIA — but how could I trust a man who had betrayed his own daughter?!"""
text33663;"""Everything was happening too quickly, I didn't have any time to figure out what consequences my actions might have."""
text33664;"""Maybe he'd come to his senses and decided to help me?"""
text33665;"""Maybe it was another of Catherine's mother's tricks?"""
text33666;"""Or, maybe, everything was much more complicated than that…"""
text33667;"""Why should I trust you? At least there's logic to Mrs Winter's words!"""
text33668;"""You know too much! Once you do what they need you to, they'll just get rid of you!"""
text33669;"""I can only help you now — any later and it will be too late!"""
text33670;"""What the hell..."""
text33671;"""I sighed and powerlessly dropped to the chair, rubbing my eyes in the vain hope it was all a mirage — but the picture, that looked like one of Bosch's, remained."""
text33672;"""My only choice was to blindly trust one of them — Ito, who had already tricked me, or Sheryl Winters, who yesterday wasn't part of the equation and today had become its most crucial factor."""
text33673;"""Nikolai, Himitsu is waiting for you!"""
text33674;"""The words were either a cheap trick or the truth."""
text33675;"""And my entire being wanted to believe that Ito wasn't lying."""
text33676;"""The lesser evil, huh?"""
text33677;"""At least there was a chance he was guided by his love for Himitsu, while Catherine's mother wasn't risking anything in this situation."""
text33678;"""She had a good shot at accusing the Soviets of espionage, but if it didn't work out it wouldn't be a setback."""
text33679;"""That's why the Americans only needed me alive only so long as I was cooperating. <w>If I was cooperating…"""
text33680;"""Fine, lead the way."""
text33681;"""I quickly changed and followed him."""
text33682;"""Walking down dark corridors, we entered a garage, not meeting a single soul on our way."""
text33683;"""It was a huge underground parking lot — most likely, we were on the basement floor of a skyscraper. <w>Kobayashi Corporation?"""
text33684;"""Ito led me to a normal looking grey car and gestured toward the back seat."""
text33685;"""I took a step forward and froze — a sense of danger pierced my entire being."""
text33686;"""The sound of metal came from behind me and Ito's quiet voice said, as if apologizing:"""
text33687;"""Sorry, Nikolai, but this is the only way I can ensure Himitsu's safety…"""
text33688;"""I had never really thought about his feelings or motives. <w>After all, he knew much more than I did."""
text33689;"""Ito might have seemed cruel and emotionless to me, but could it be that his true motivation was his daughter's safety?"""
text33690;"""After all, love isn't all there is to life, and looking at it objectively, I wasn't the best match for her."""
text33691;"""A person dragged into the conflict between the KGB and the CIA, a stranger in an alien country, an orphan without a dime."""
text33692;"""What would I have done if I were Ito?"""
text33693;"""Besides, he could have gotten rid of me long ago, quietly and without any consequences."""
text33694;"""He would've told Himitsu that I'd been kidnapped by Soviet spies! <w>Or the Americans, or Martians — what difference would it make?!"""
text33695;"""She would have to believe it or, at least, accept it."""
text33696;"""Maybe, in a different life, she could have persuaded her father that her love for me was more important than anything else… <w>but in this one, I got what I deserved."""
text33697;"""The last moment of my life dragged on too long, even: the dull sound of a gunshot, a light push against the back of my head — and my entire life flashed before my eyes."""
text33698;"""And in almost every memory, I saw Himitsu — happy, smiling, sad, crying, passionate, upset, disappointed, loving, and beloved."""
text33699;"""\""This doesn't feel right…\"""""
text33700;"""Let it be!"""
text33701;"""Even if I had to lie, betray my parents' memory — it was all for Himitsu's sake… <w>Right?"""
text33702;"""I was pacing around the room, unable to decide whether or not I'd done the right thing."""
text33703;"""The thought wouldn't leave me alone, an itch from which there was no salvation."""
text33704;"""Had I become a traitor by agreeing to everything Mrs Winters wanted me to say?"""
text33705;"""Or was I just saving my own life?"""
text33706;"""What worth are ideals when no one would know about them after my death?"""
text33707;"""I'd have to \""live with it\""? <w>At least I'd <i>live</i>!"""
text33708;"""And still, something was eating at me — guilt or my own powerlessness."""
text33709;"""To lose control over your own life, to be forced to make decisions that disgust you — isn't that the scariest thing there could be?"""
text33710;"""\""A slave who not only eschews a striving for freedom but justifies and eulogizes his slavery — such a slave is a lickspittle and a boor\""."""
text33711;"""Wasn't I only trying to justify my collaborationism?"""
text33712;"""But it's easy to worry over morality when you aren't faced with this kind of choice."""
text33713;"""It's convenient to label others when you aren't risking your own life."""
text33714;"""I agreed to Mrs Winters' terms — to save myself and Himitsu."""
text33715;"""The reason would soon be forgotten — only the consequences would remain, with which I… <w>we would have to live."""
text33716;"""But at least we would <i>live</i>!"""
text33717;"""The door opened without a sound, and Catherine's mother entered the room."""
text33718;"""Sorry to keep you waiting."""
text33719;"""She said politely and sat across from me."""
text33720;"""Here is what will happen next…"""
text33721;"""She told me what I had to say and how I had to act."""
text33722;"""Most of the words sounded like lines from a dictionary — they carried no meaning out of context."""
text33723;"""I was positive I would hear it all again, more than once."""
text33724;"""Nikolai, have you understood everything?"""
text33725;"""Yes…"""
text33726;"""I replied and lowered my head — I had no strength to look her in the eyes."""
text33727;"""Come on, cheer up! The hardest part comes first, but you'll get used to it…"""
text33728;"""Get used to what? <w>Prison life?"""
text33729;"""I didn't have the courage to say that out loud."""
text33730;"""Mrs Winters looked confident, which was natural, since she was in complete control of the situation."""
text33731;"""I could only wonder how this woman had planned everything so skillfully, taken every possibility into account, and predicted the actions of every party."""
text33732;"""And I was just another pawn in her game…"""
text33733;"""After… I do all that, will you let Himitsu go?"""
text33734;"""You can be sure of it! I give you my word!"""
text33735;"""She bared her teeth in a semblance of a good-natured grin. I knew well it was just the gracious gesture of a lion toward the lamb it only kept alive to be eaten the next day."""
text33736;"""…"""
text33737;"""Then there was an endless series of interrogations."""
text33738;"""First, the Americans prepared me for what I had to tell the Japanese."""
text33739;"""Days passed by one by one, monotonous and identical."""
text33740;"""I wasn't let outside, and when I first got out into the city, wearing a suit that didn't fit — of course a grey one — winter had already come."""
text33741;"""At that moment, Nikolai Anokhin was ready to answer any question regarding his <i>spying</i>. <w>He could even effortlessly cheat a polygraph test."""
text33742;"""Over the time I spent in captivity, I somehow came to terms with what I had coming."""
text33743;"""I persuaded myself that <i>this</i> was the only way. <w>The only chance to save myself and Himitsu."""
text33744;"""A person who willingly rejects their freedom loses the very meaning of their existence."""
text33745;"""Their attitude towards life, themselves, and others, changes irreversibly."""
text33746;"""Freedom of choice, the ability to make decisions independently and thus rise above natural instinct, allows us to become something more than intelligent monkeys able to hold a stick."""
text33747;"""Monkeys are also able of choosing a partner for mating and, following instinct, protecting their kin, but the concepts of love and sacrifice are alien to them."""
text33748;"""Meanwhile, a human, when placing the interests of another individual above their own and doing so consciously, rises above its animal nature and establishes the supremacy of spirit over matter."""
text33749;"""From there on out, our conscious self begins to define our path — not the instincts of an animal."""
text33750;"""Most of all, I was tormented by contradictions: freedom — happiness, love — freedom."""
text33751;"""Had I done the right thing by sacrificing my freedom, and wouldn't that sacrifice be useless?"""
text33752;"""But everything progressed at so fast a pace I barely had any time to think about it."""
text33753;"""The Japanese interrogators turned out to be much more meticulous than the Americans, and, although I had been prepared for that, would have been able to break anyone."""
text33754;"""Fortunately I just had to say what they wanted to hear, and all the interrogations boiled down to me confirming that my words were true."""
text33755;"""It's common knowledge that the easiest thing to believe is what you want to believe."""
text33756;"""In the end, I passed every test with flying colors."""
text33757;"""Then the trial started, and it was the first time in a long time that I had to communicate with so many people."""
text33758;"""Luckily, since most of the information related to my case was classified, it was a closed trial,"""
text33759;"""I was even given a defense attorney, but it all looked like — and was, in fact, — a mere formality."""
text33760;"""It was immediately clear who knew the trial was pure theatre and who didn't."""
text33761;"""People from the first category talked to me as little as they could and only according to protocol, while those from the second category (there were much fewer of those) actually tried to get to the truth."""
text33762;"""They were often surprised by my dull reactions and seeming disinterest in my own fate."""
text33763;"""What was so surprising when Nikolai Anokhin was just a prop for the triumph of <i>justice</i>, the <i>proof</i> to unmask the blatant <i>conspiracy</i> of the genocidal Communist regime?"""
text33764;"""That's when I really understood how small the difference was between the reds and the stripes-and-stars when it came to money and imperial ambitions."""
text33765;"""If you're lucky, through the lens of human history, you might end up as two dates with a dash between them in a school book."""
text33766;"""How many lives hide behind that line?"""
text33767;"""Perhaps in twenty years Irina would be mentioned in an article in the Big Soviet Encyclopaedia, Ito would be honored with a monument, and Sheryl Winters would become the first female president…"""
text33768;"""Who would remember the nameless Japanese school kid with Russian roots?"""
text33769;"""All of them had their freedom of choice, the unlimited freedom that at some point becomes a power of its own — the proof of absolute superiority of the individual above others."""
text33770;"""Money, power, and millions of followers that blindly believe in the idea of the inviolability of private property or the victory of the worldwide proletariat revolution, become fertile ground for the formation of ideologies that are transcendental in nature."""
text33771;"""And then it's them that control the people, replacing freedom with their will."""
text33772;"""And neither a ruler nor a simple worker notice that they are willing to sacrifice everything for the <i>triumph</i> of what they believe in."""
text33773;"""The only difference is that a regular person can only put his or her own life on the altar of that idea, while a ruler can sacrifice millions."""
text33774;"""But history often moves forward against people's will."""
text33775;"""Who said that every era of our civilization is unequivocally defined by some higher pattern?"""
text33776;"""Ideologies are like viruses, the only difference between the two is that a person <i>infected</i> by one ideology isn't likely to <i>contract</i> another."""
text33777;"""They spread from individual to individual, capturing more and more space."""
text33778;"""They are inherited, integrated into our cultural code — and one can't imagine the population of a certain region of the Earth without attaching them to a certain ideology or religion (which are basically one and the same)."""
text33779;"""All Russians are communists, all Americans are capitalists, and all Japanese honor their elders and social hierarchies."""
text33780;"""And so we find ourselves in a world where <i>human rights</i> are more important than humans themselves!"""
text33781;"""It's now more right and <i>prestigious</i> to defend abstract concepts like \""refugees\"", \""freedom fighters\"", \""prisoners of conscience\"", and minorities."""
text33782;"""On the other hand, it's enough to claim oppression to immediately gain the sympathy of millions."""
text33783;"""Most likely that's where it would end, but you might get lucky — for example, someone might organize a charity for you, from which you might get something after all the taxes and employees' salaries are deducted."""
text33784;"""In the end, our civilization moves further away from the individual person and towards a simulacrum of a person."""
text33785;"""Reality, becoming more and more complicated every year, no long has room for billions of people, each their own individual, and allocates them to controlled groups based on religion, race, social status, and income."""
text33786;"""And woe is not those in the poorest or the most oppressed groups, but those that don't fit any of them!"""
text33787;"""Testifying against myself and my dead parents, I became one of those people."""
text33788;"""The trial became, in essence, a formality and ended quickly."""
text33789;"""The most important thing was to uncover the <i>criminal</i> activity of the Soviets, then quickly remove all actors from the scene — or they might say something they shouldn't have."""
text33790;"""Under different circumstances it would've probably been easier to eliminate me, but since my face was in the newspapers and on television for some time, the risk of getting involved in a scandal with those <i>human rights activists</i> was too great for Sheryl Winters."""
text33791;"""And who was I to judge her motives and try to guess what that woman, who had managed to so easily outplay the KGB and manipulate the Japanese like puppets, thought?"""
text33792;"""The trial ended, and the sentence was harsh: ten years."""
text33793;"""I only had to hope that Catherine's mother would keep to her word…"""
text33794;"""Japanese society traditionally treats foreigners badly, and Japanese prison is the last place foreigners would want to end up in!"""
text33795;"""I wouldn't want to recall all the fear and humiliation I had to go through there — luckily, my sentence didn't last long, as something unexpected happened after a few months."""
text33796;"""I received a general pardon…"""
text33797;"""I had no doubt that Mrs Winters had a hand in it."""
text33798;"""At first glance, everything was finally behind me. But unfulfilled hopes can hurt more than physical restrictions…"""
text33799;"""Don't trust, don't fear, don't beg?"""
text33800;"""Himitsu didn't visit me even once in prison — I attributed it to the fact that not much time had passed yet and patiently waited for any news from her."""
text33801;"""However, once I was released, I found out that she had moved… <w>along with Ito."""
text33802;"""They'd sold their house, and other people were living in there."""
text33803;"""At first, I could calm myself with the thought that her father had hidden her from me again."""
text33804;"""But this time somewhere other than her grandma's house."""
text33805;"""Whom I stalked for several days — to no effect."""
text33806;"""My house had been seized by the authorities."""
text33807;"""I didn't know whether they had the right to do so or not, and I had neither the money nor the knowledge to sue them."""
text33808;"""Kyosuke was afraid to let an ex-convict live at his place — he explained it away by saying his mother had forbidden it."""
text33809;"""At first he helped me financially, I rented a tiny room in the suburbs and spent all my time trying to find Himitsu."""
text33810;"""I found everyone in her family to the seventh generation, called even the most remote relative, came to school again and again trying to find out where she had been transferred to, but in the end only learned that her father had collected her documents in person."""
text33811;"""Time passed, and more and more I noticed I no longer felt my failures as strongly."""
text33812;"""In the beginning, I had been overtaken by desperation, but then I gradually began to accept my new life, the fact that I would never see Himitsu again."""
text33813;"""The surprise, the shock, the inability to quickly adapt to a new, changed situation — it's all understandable, can be fought, lived with."""
text33814;"""It's worse when you start thinking that things are fine the way they are."""
text33815;"""After all, I did <i>everything</i> I could, searched <i>everywhere</i>, asked <i>everyone</i>."""
text33816;"""Japan is huge — Himitsu could be anywhere!"""
text33817;"""What was I supposed to do? <w>I had no money, no connections, and, most importantly, no hope…"""
text33818;"""The pittance Kyosuke had given me soon ran out, and I had to postpone my search for Himitsu until further opportunity under threat of starvation."""
text33819;"""I tried to contact Irina or someone from the embassy but to no avail."""
text33820;"""The KGB seemed to have forgotten about my existence, and Soviet diplomats politely refused my advances."""
text33821;"""Since you are a citizen, boy, live in Japan!"""
text33822;"""All these petty details, formalities, bureaucracy, and administrative barriers are utterly repulsive to the vast Russian soul — however, by some unfortunate coincidence, I wasn't born an aristocrat with an estate and a hundred serfs."""
text33823;"""When I finally came to my senses, spring had started, the school year ended, and it was too late to go back to school."""
text33824;"""I couldn't even think of trying to reenroll and get a diploma."""
text33825;"""I simply had no time left for studying!"""
text33826;"""I started searching for a job, but it was as if almost every employer in Tokyo had a blacklist with me at the very top."""
text33827;"""Of course, I couldn't exclude the possibility — it could be Ito's or even Mrs Winters' revenge."""
text33828;"""It only made it look even weirder that I had been released so early."""
text33829;"""And my criminal record… <w>I couldn't forget about that."""
text33830;"""In the end, I managed to get a job at a port as a dock worker."""
text33831;"""I only had enough money for rent, some food without much flavor or nutrition, and alcohol."""
text33832;"""A bottle of sake after a shift, two bottles, three… <w>I could no longer fall asleep without that."""
text33833;"""I didn't connect with any of my colleagues."""
text33834;"""Maybe because I was a gaijin."""
text33835;"""Or, maybe, because I still considered myself smarter and <i>above</i> menial laborers."""
text33836;"""The hubris and snobbishness of a person stuck in a pigsty towards his companions in misfortune — what could describe my character better?"""
text33837;"""Unnoticeably, the thought that Himitsu didn't want to see me started to come more and more to mind."""
text33838;"""Otherwise, she would've found a way…"""
text33839;"""I tried not to think about that — if she had had an opportunity, Himitsu would've definitely contacted me."""
text33840;"""It meant Ito was keeping her under lock and key!"""
text33841;"""Yeah, right, in a dungeon… <w>in a cage… <w>on a chain…"""
text33842;"""Unfortunately, this <i>excuse</i> just sounded ridiculous!"""
text33843;"""What if something had happened…"""
text33844;"""No! <w>I didn't want to believe that."""
text33845;"""But time <i>heals</i>, it erases memories and feelings, slowly, but incessantly."""
text33846;"""Time can make mountains disappear, let alone a fragile and unstable person."""
text33847;"""It passionlessly dims the light of even seemingly eternal love and wipes all memories of it from people's minds."""
text33848;"""And there I was, coming to my senses in a dirty alley a year later, rain falling from the sky blocked by leaden, heavy clouds, washing off the last remnants of color from the world, turning existence into a canvas filled with endless grey paint."""
text33849;"""As if an artist, disappointed with their painting, had thrown a bucket of whitewash over it."""
text33850;"""If only I could start everything anew…"""
text33851;"""If I could know every danger that awaited me in advance, knew what I had to say and do..."""
text33852;"""Damn it, I would've bought an almanac with sport statistics and handed it to myself in the past!"""
text33853;"""But in real life, I was stuck in a dead end that I couldn't escape by tracing my path back."""
text33854;"""Today I drank through the money I had borrowed from a buddy until payday."""
text33855;"""And still had to survive until then somehow."""
text33856;"""Although I was more preoccupied with the thought that I had nothing to buy booze with…"""
text33857;"""The rain grew stronger, and I remembered Himitsu's smile, her puffed cheeks — and choked on silent sobs."""
text33858;"""Where was she now? What was she doing...?"""
text33859;"""I had come to terms, forgotten, and stopped, unable to find the energy to keep fighting, finding it pointless."""
text33860;"""Any sensible person would've probably done the same, but not everyone would have stooped so low."""
text33861;"""Oh yes, I felt I'd hit the bottom, the very abyss of the human anthill."""
text33862;"""Only the homeless and criminals were worth less than me, and my only difference from them was purely formal — my sentence had been served and I was renting a place to live."""
text33863;"""In reality, I had long stopped hoping that my life would ever be the same again."""
text33864;"""What's the main difference between an <i>outcast</i> and a normal person?"""
text33865;"""The former's pathetic appearance, poverty, sickness, the contempt that they receive from others? Or is it something else, not obvious at first glance?"""
text33866;"""Now I knew the answer: what breaks a person is the loss of hope, not any external factors!"""
text33867;"""Just yesterday you believed in a better future, if only a little, if only in your heart, knowing in your mind that all the best is long left behind, and ahead there is only loneliness, emptiness, and death."""
text33868;"""And today you make peace with it, finally look into the face of what's coming with courage, stop deceiving yourself with daydreams, you… <w>I'd become what I despised my entire life!"""
text33869;"""I saw my arch enemy in the mirror — but it wasn't a devil with a sarcastic smile, neither was it Providence hidden in a black robe or the nameless mask of a hostile society, it was my own face, haggard and seemingly aged by a dozen years."""
text33870;"""Well, a discarded person no longer has any right to complain."""
text33871;"""Neither do they need to: don't trust, don't fear, don't beg!"""
text33872;"""Taken out of the equation, they no longer have to follow its rules."""
text33873;"""Perhaps this was the cunning revenge of Sheryl Winters?"""
text33874;"""She knew I'd find it harder to be <i>free</i> than imprisoned."""
text33875;"""In prison, I would be suffering — physically and mentally — but would have to adapt to certain rules and laws, become part of a certain group."""
text33876;"""Here and now I was merely a lonely, desperate lowlife, the slag of consumer society, recycled and deemed no longer suitable for use."""
text33877;"""Was it really Catherine's mother's plan, or did I just make it all up as I spent long nights staring at the ceiling with my eyes clouded by cheap sake?"""
text33878;"""Anyway, it was too late to look for someone to blame, and neither was there any sense to it."""
text33879;"""That was also a distinctive Russian trait."""
text33880;"""Although I'd never liked to shift the blame for what happened to me to others."""
text33881;"""Simply because it wouldn't change a thing."""
text33882;"""I could blame Mrs Winters, Ito, the Japanese, the KGB, even Himitsu — but it wouldn't bring her back!"""
text33883;"""And then, I was sure of it, the last stage would come: acceptance."""
text33884;"""I would stop considering my job the bottom of my life, start going to a bar with my <i>colleagues</i>, rent a bigger flat, maybe even find a girlfriend…"""
text33885;"""An ugly, fat Japanese woman that would laugh with and without reason, baring her crooked teeth and squinting her already barely visible eyes."""
text33886;"""And then there would be children…"""
text33887;"""I would probably get a promotion, and we would be able to get a mortgage for a house in the suburbs."""
text33888;"""Then there would be retirement and death."""
text33889;"""Was it all Himitsu's fault?"""
text33890;"""Hot raindrops ran down my cheeks — although those were most likely my tears."""
text33891;"""Strangely enough, I hadn't cried in a while. <w>A year or so."""
text33892;"""The last time it happened was when I first realized I wouldn't be able to find Himitsu."""
text33893;"""This was probably my last."""
text45925;"""Perhaps I lived even better than some rich and famous people. After all, I was still alive, as opposed to some singer girl who had died recently."""
text33894;"""In the life of a normal Japanese worker, there is no need to cry, maybe only regret the years pointlessly spent."""
text33895;"""I was sure that by that time my brain would be so full of alcohol and fat that, as part of this necro-evolution, the ability to experience such complex emotions would die out on its own"""
text33896;"""So today I was saying goodbye to my past, to my short-lived love for Himitsu."""
text33897;"""I was saying goodbye to Kyosuke, Michael, and the big empty house taken by the state as compensation for debts that came out of nowhere."""
text33898;"""I was saying goodbye to my youth and all my foolish dreams of happiness."""
text33899;"""Happiness as I understood it was completely unnecessary for an <i>adult</i> person. Moreover, the very idea of it was harmful and destabilizing for a sensible member of society."""
text33900;"""That's what I had to become to survive."""
text33901;"""And despite everything, I had absolutely no desire to die. <w>Perhaps I was just afraid of death…"""
text33902;"""But most likely there was a different reason that was sitting deep inside and that I couldn't quite comprehend myself."""
text33903;"""Like the instinctive fear of the unknown: it's better be <i>like this</i> here, where I know everything, than to go <i>there</i>, where I know nothing."""
text33904;"""And most importantly, I never, not even for a second, allowed myself to think that I would be able to love anyone but Himitsu."""
text33905;"""Well, so be it: our story may have ended, I may have lost faith, and life may have proved the needlessness of hope, but in a different world — not necessarily better, but a <i>different</i> one — it was snowing, not raining so wretchedly, and a different Niko-kun was making a snowman with a different Himitsu!"""
text33906;"""But the choice was made, and even if I would regret it, that would come later, after I had endured this torturous waiting."""
text33907;"""The cramped room seemed to have become even more so, the silence broken only by the monotonous sound of the fan, only a grey wall visible behind the small window."""
text33908;"""How often do we regret what we haven't done in life or have done wrongly, the people we have lost?"""
text33909;"""I saw no escape — Mrs Winters' promises sounded like empty words, this entire situation resembled a silly game."""
text33910;"""Finally, a key turned in the keyhole quietly, the door opened, and in the doorway stood…"""
text33911;"""Ito."""
text33912;"""I was tired of being surprised, but I still didn't expect to see him of all people here!"""
text33913;"""Nikolai, we have five minutes to get you out of here."""
text33914;"""He threw me a bag that I caught on reflex."""
text33915;"""Change into this."""
text33916;"""Inside was a blue uniform, like the ones mailmen wear."""
text33917;"""What does this mean?"""
text33918;"""You either ask me questions or we run!"""
text33919;"""Himitsu?"""
text33920;"""I asked briefly, clenching the bag in my hands."""
text33921;"""She's fine — I've taken care of it. Now we have to get you out of this building!"""
text33922;"""Why are you helping me?"""
text33923;"""I probably shouldn't have argued with Ito."""
text33924;"""I had to either trust him or wait for Mrs Winters' return."""
text33925;"""The second option looked idiotic no matter what."""
text33926;"""Of course, that woman didn't lack for cunning, sure, but I found it impossible to believe that she had planned this too. <w>Why would she?"""
text33927;"""Do you want to stay here?"""
text33928;"""Just yesterday I wouldn't have believed a single world of his, but at that moment, what difference did it make who exactly was offering me salvation?"""
text33929;"""At least Ito would take me out of this room — and that was better than remaining imprisoned by the CIA."""
text33930;"""Besides, I'd rejected Catherine's mother's <i>offer</i>, so the only sensible response I could expect from them was a bullet to the head."""
text33931;"""Just so you know, I still think you're a terrible person!"""
text33932;"""<note=note159>You may call me even a pot, just don't put me into the oven!</note>"""
text33933;"""He said in Russian, which made me smile despite myself."""
text33934;"""…"""
text33935;"""We walked down dark corridors to an underground garage and then outside."""
text33936;"""The bright daylight blinded me and I couldn't quite figure out where I was right away."""
text33937;"""We stopped — it was the square near the Kobayashi Corporation building. <w>That was, actually, no surprise."""
text33938;"""This seems too easy…"""
text33939;"""Was this another trick?"""
text33940;"""Nobody thought you would run away."""
text33941;"""If they have such a low opinion of me, why do <i>you</i> need me?"""
text33942;"""After you refused to do what Winters needed you to, I realized you really do love Himitsu."""
text33943;"""What's the connection here?"""
text33944;"""I really didn't understand."""
text33945;"""The resulting investigation would have obviously effected me and, consequently, Himitsu. In the best case, I'd only lose my job, but in the worst case…"""
text33946;"""He sighed and shifted his gaze to the sky — to where it was pierced by the spike of the Kobayashi Corporation building."""
text33947;"""Of course, she promised me that everything would be fine, that our safety is guaranteed…"""
text33948;"""What will happen to you now?"""
text33949;"""Don't worry. I've been in the field for a while, I know how to take care of myself. And you will have to take care of my daughter. Can you promise me that you will?"""
text33950;"""Of course!"""
text33951;"""I said in too serious a voice."""
text33952;"""Everything was changing too quickly, in particular what I thought of this man."""
text33953;"""In the end, Ito had been doing everything for Himitsu's safety."""
text33954;"""I've already contacted the KGB — they'll pick you up at the place we agreed on."""
text33955;"""He looked at his watch again."""
text33956;"""They'll realize you're gone soon, we have to go."""
text33957;"""…"""
text33958;"""We took a taxi to the suburbs of Tokyo."""
text33959;"""On the way there, Ito told me that many years ago he was assigned to spy on Soviet engineers who had fled to Japan."""
text33960;"""They were working on a secret project for Kobayashi Corporation, but soon were suspected of spying for the USSR."""
text33961;"""Double agents — I guess that's what it's called?"""
text33962;"""The Corporation wasn't the only party participating in the Project, there were also Americans and at their head, Sheryl Winters."""
text33963;"""Ito himself was, mostly, just a small fry, a support agent from the government."""
text33964;"""He knew neither about the true goal of the Project, nor the part my parents had worked on."""
text33965;"""He also had nothing to do with their death."""
text33966;"""According to him, that is…"""
text33967;"""But now I had far fewer reasons to doubt his words."""
text33968;"""When we arrived, I had to deal with Irina's snarky smile, and then finally saw Himitsu."""
text33969;"""It felt as if we had parted at least a year ago."""
text33970;"""She was alright."""
text33971;"""For a long time she was saying her goodbyes to her father, crying, not wanting to leave."""
text33972;"""I gave him a firm handshake, realizing that it was unlikely we would ever see each other again."""
text33973;"""The Americans may have thought me a simple high school kid before, but now to them I would become an enemy of the state."""
text33974;"""When we were put on a Soviet cargo ship in the port, Himitsu was no longer so enthusiastic about the USSR."""
text33975;"""The cabin where you could barely stand at full height, the rocking, and the terrible food — it probably wasn't her idea of a <i>spy's</i> life."""
text33976;"""Meanwhile, I wasn't worried about any of that at all — I was happy that I had finally managed to escape the endless cycle of paranoia and anxious expectation of danger."""
text33977;"""Besides, something finally filled the empty spot in my heart — the one that had appeared after my parents' death and my breakup with Catherine."""
text33978;"""Their place was taken by my love for Himitsu — a feeling that brought some meaning to my existence again."""
text33979;"""So what if many difficulties and hardships lay ahead of us?"""
text33980;"""So what if we would need to adapt to another country and lifestyle?"""
text33981;"""Those really are <i>trifles</i> so long as you're with the person you love!"""
text33982;"""Of course, I wanted Himitsu to think the same…"""
text33983;"""However, her knowledge of Russian helped to somewhat mitigate the significant difference in cultures, especially in the beginning."""
text33984;"""Despite the accent, she didn't stand out much in terms of her looks — and that helped us look like any normal young Soviet family."""
text33985;"""We were put up in a town in the central part of the country, but were allowed to meet with our relatives."""
text33986;"""Himitsu met her mother for the first time in a long while, and, as always, spent a lot of time crying."""
text33987;"""The one bedroom apartment and the realities of Soviet daily life were quite different from my childhood memories."""
text33988;"""The two-hundred-and-forty centimeter tall ceilings and the kitchen of four square metres were probably the height of dreams for most of the proletariat, but to me at first it seemed to be a parody of a real home, like a dollhouse."""
text33989;"""Our handlers from the KGB insisted we had to blend in completely, and I would have even pitied the <i>normal</i> Soviet citizen, if I hadn't become one!"""
text33990;"""Of course, there were also positives."""
text33991;"""To me personally, the people seemed more sincere and honest than the Japanese, and more hospitable once you got to know them better."""
text33992;"""Himitsu, on the other hand, just couldn't come to understand that her usual politeness was excessive there."""
text33993;"""We were given high school diplomas and allocated jobs — I became an assistant miller at a factory, while Himitsu got the position of shopkeeper at a bakery."""
text33994;"""At first, she protested vehemently, insisting she wanted do further study, but it was too dangerous. <w>At least that's what they said."""
text33995;"""But, they also assured us that in five years we would be free to lead our own lives, without the control of the state security service."""
text33996;"""Of course, given my experience with Irina, I didn't exactly believe that, but five years is a long time."""
text33997;"""Anything could happen to me and to the country in general!"""
text33998;"""Just a month ago I sincerely believed that I would spend my entire life in that old Tokyo home."""
text33999;"""A week ago I wasn't even sure I would stay alive for any significant length of time."""
text34000;"""And today I wasn't only alive and healthy, but also with the girl I loved..."""
text34001;"""Why can't most people believe in miracles, even when they happen before their very eyes?"""
text34002;"""The reason for it is our habit of searching for a logical explanation for anything that happens to us."""
text34003;"""A hundred or two hundred years ago, we lived with gods and demons, spirits of our ancestors and pantheistic entities."""
text34004;"""Today our world has expanded significantly — to neighboring planets and stars, other galaxies and parallel universes, but the internal world of each individual has shriveled incredibly."""
text34005;"""We were left alone with ourselves and the endless void of space."""
text34006;"""Where do you find room for something magical in it?"""
text34007;"""That is how it seemed to me, magical, that we were sitting in the kitchen and drinking tea as if that's how it was always meant to be!"""
text34008;"""In a Soviet kitchen, thousands of kilometres away from Japan."""
text34009;"""In a Soviet kitchen, after work in a Soviet factory."""
text34010;"""In a Soviet apartment, with real entresols!"""
text34011;"""In a Soviet apartment, where in a cabinet made out of Soviet chipboard our new, still smelling of ink, Soviet passports lay."""
text34012;"""But still with the girl I'd known my entire life. <w>Or was she a different one…?"""
text34013;"""What are you thinking about?"""
text34014;"""Himitsu asked me with a smile."""
text34015;"""I just can't believe it's all real. It's as if an alarm is about to go off and I'll wake up."""
text34016;"""And then have to go to school…"""
text34017;"""She laughed, as genuinely as ever but in a more adult way now — laughter that had no place for naivety."""
text34018;"""You're probably happy they didn't make us finish our studies?"""
text34019;"""Of course I am! Like I need any more of that bliss in my life! And anyway…"""
text34020;"""Himitsu was getting more and more used to her new life with each passing day, having met all the neighbors and even made a very good impression on the local old ladies."""
text34021;"""Unlike me — I was immediately labeled as a weirdo here as well."""
text34022;"""Apparently, that was my destiny…"""
text34023;"""…and then Tanya said: \""I..."""
text34024;"""She was telling me about what had happened at work."""
text34025;"""I couldn't stop being surprised by how much happiness she could find in absolutely mundane things."""
text34026;"""Don't you miss it?"""
text34027;"""I'd never asked her that question before, probably because I was scared of how she might react."""
text34028;"""Do I miss what?"""
text34029;"""Japan."""
text34030;"""Himitsu took some time to reply."""
text34031;"""Of course I do, how can't I? But my home is here now, with you."""
text34032;"""Well… uh…"""
text34033;"""I grew embarrassed."""
text34034;"""Niko-kun, do you still feel guilty?"""
text34035;"""Hey, we talked about that!"""
text34036;"""Honorific suffixes are alien to the Russian language and just confuse the people who speak it."""
text34037;"""But nobody can hear us here!"""
text34038;"""Are you sure about that?"""
text34039;"""I demonstratively looked around the kitchen."""
text34040;"""The walls have ears too!"""
text34041;"""I said in a stage whisper."""
text34042;"""Let them listen!"""
text34043;"""We had nothing to hide, and I was genuinely glad about that."""
text34044;"""So what do you want me to call you then?"""
text34045;"""What... what everyone does! Kolya!"""
text34046;"""I blurted out without a second thought."""
text34047;"""Fine, Kolya…"""
text34048;"""Coming from her, it sounded completely wrong!"""
text34049;"""Alright, let's think about this harder!"""
text34050;"""She took a sip of her tea and frowned:"""
text34051;"""You're always like this… No matter what happens in the country, one thing is consistent — Niko-kun's tomfoolery!"""
text34052;"""Where did you even learn a word like that?"""
text34053;"""I got a library card!"""
text34054;"""Himitsu fired back in good nature."""
text34055;"""Do they have manga there?"""
text34056;"""I don't know. Go and take a look. And if you don't find any, borrow something more intellectual."""
text34057;"""More intellectual than manga?!"""
text34058;"""She sighed and said in a totally different tone, as if daydreaming:"""
text34059;"""One day I will meet my prince…"""
text34060;"""Vasya from the axle bearing production line!"""
text34061;"""I remarked immediately."""
text34062;"""…and we will create a social square…"""
text34063;"""A social unit."""
text34064;"""I corrected her in the same swift fashion."""
text34065;"""…a social unit."""
text34066;"""It wasn't the first time Himitsu had hinted at marriage."""
text34067;"""<note=note157>But marriage can be faulty, too, as they said at our factory!</note>"""
text34068;"""Although our handlers from the KGB were on her side."""
text34069;"""Cohabitation wasn't a crime in Soviet Union, but it was frowned upon."""
text34070;"""And I knew that the time would come sooner or later."""
text34071;"""Who shall we take as witnesses?"""
text34072;"""It's really a strange word you know. Like in, well..."""
text34073;"""A murder?"""
text34074;"""I chimed in."""
text34075;"""Yes! Just like those at a crime scene!"""
text34076;"""Some people actually see us as criminals..."""
text34077;"""Himitsu lowered her eyes."""
text34078;"""In the US and Japan."""
text34079;"""I finished nonetheless."""
text34080;"""Not only us."""
text34081;"""You mean your dad...? I'm sure he's doing alright!"""
text34082;"""But that didn't sound very reassuring."""
text34083;"""He's a professional, after all! Wait a year or two — he'll definitely contact us. Maybe he'll even babysit his grandchildren!"""
text34084;"""G-grandchildren?!"""
text34085;"""Himitsu blushed."""
text34086;"""Well, he would have to one day…"""
text34087;"""I averted my gaze, as if embarrassed by something."""
text34088;"""You've thought about it yourself! Don't tell me that… We've been living together for… And you…"""
text34089;"""I was rambling, unable to even finish my sentences, trying to justify myself."""
text34090;"""Mhm"""
text34091;"""Himitsu just mumbled vaguely in response."""
text34092;"""So…"""
text34093;"""Yes…"""
text34094;"""Children were indeed something I hadn't yet thought about."""
text34095;"""Did I want them? <w>In reality, not just hypothetically?"""
text34096;"""Of course, our income and living conditions weren't quite favorable to a bundle of joy, but if we thought like that we'd wait all the way to retirement!"""
text34097;"""They weren't good, yes — but they could become better tomorrow."""
text34098;"""I still want to become a teacher."""
text34099;"""Himitsu changed the subject."""
text34100;"""A primary school one, at least."""
text34101;"""Why not a Russian teacher?"""
text34102;"""Because."""
text34103;"""She smiled and again it occurred to me that Himitsu seemed to have become older."""
text34104;"""Not so much in appearance as in the impression she made on those around her."""
text34105;"""Her facial expression, movements, gestures, and a new, serious gleam in her eyes."""
text34106;"""Not to even mention how easily she had adapted to this alien environment."""
text34107;"""I was finding it much harder and mostly endured thanks to a new feeling I had discovered — this strong and confident love."""
text34108;"""But I want a boy!"""
text34109;"""Can't make one on order."""
text34110;"""She grunted."""
text34111;"""And then a girl, maybe…"""
text34112;"""I'm not an incubator!"""
text34113;"""I always thought you wanted a big family."""
text34114;"""I do…"""
text34115;"""We had to either change the subject or immediately make love to each other."""
text34116;"""However, I was too tired after my shift, so I decided not to prolong the awkward pause:"""
text34117;"""Well, then you'll have to change your surname."""
text34118;"""What do you mean?"""
text34119;"""After the wedding."""
text34120;"""Ah, yeah…"""
text34121;"""She said, as if she didn't understand what this was about."""
text34122;"""I'm quite happy with your new one."""
text34123;"""Following the KGB's <i>recommendation</i>, I had to change my surname — so I took my mother's maiden name, which was logical."""
text34124;"""Thank God."""
text34125;"""I sighed and took a sip of my camomile tea, by now cold."""
text34126;"""Niko-kun…"""
text34127;"""She said to me, somewhat hesitantly."""
text34128;"""What?"""
text34129;"""If it's a boy, what will we name him...?"""
text34130;"""..."""

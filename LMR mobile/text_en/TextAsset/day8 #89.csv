text36452;"""My parents and I were returning from a countryside trip."""
text36453;"""We wanted to see the Japanese outdoors, observe the sakura blossoms."""
text36454;"""My father talked non-stop, but I wasn't listening to him — all my thoughts were centered around Catherine."""
text36455;"""We hadn't seen each other much over the break — I wondered if she missed me."""
text36456;"""I sure did!"""
text36457;"""Mostly, I think, because I could stay at her place till late, as Mrs Winters would usually come home long after midnight."""
text36458;"""So we could sit, lie, and stand…"""
text36459;"""In the bedroom, guest room, bathroom, or even the hallway with walls thin enough to hear the neighbors walk by."""
text36460;"""\""Are you listening to me?!\"" — my father shouted."""
text36461;"""But I had other things on my mind."""
text36462;"""And then…"""
text36463;"""Then I woke up in a hospital."""
text36464;"""Bruises, abrasions and a broken arm — things could be way worse."""
text36465;"""Maybe if I had been listening to him…"""
text36466;"""…"""
text36467;"""People always say \""it's better to sleep on it\""… <w>Bullshit!"""
text36468;"""Especially if you couldn't actually sleep the whole night."""
text36469;"""In this case, trying to sleep on it didn't help at all — I could barely think straight."""
text36470;"""In the past eight hours I'd imagined virtually everything: being interrogated in the confines of the KGB, being exposed to ancient Japanese torture by people from the Corporation, <i>just</i> being executed by a single shot to the head."""
text36471;"""It was all wrong…"""
text36472;"""A human being can't feel fear constantly — at some point, the mind's defense mechanisms kick in, and you simply stop caring about anything that might happen to you."""
text36473;"""And unexpectedly, I realized that I was worried about Himitsu much more than about my own life."""
text36474;"""She was the closest person I had, meaning that they could get to her as well!"""
text36475;"""Catherine? <w>Her mother could protect her, and, somehow, I was confident that she could take care of herself."""
text36476;"""A weak and cowardly person wouldn't have written that note, wouldn't have cared someone other than herself."""
text36477;"""Was she really worried about me?"""
text36478;"""A pleasant shiver ran through my entire body, a sensation I had seemingly long forgotten."""
text36479;"""What if she had her own circumstances I simply knew nothing about?"""
text36480;"""And then… <w>Could I lose her too?!"""
text36481;"""It was incredibly difficult to answer the \""Who do I love?\"" question even to myself. <w>Especially in my current condition."""
text36482;"""There was one thing I knew for sure — both of them were important to me. <w>Now more than ever!"""
text36483;"""I rolled to my other side and looked at the clock — it was still pretty early, but I no longer had the energy to stay in bed."""
text36484;"""I could try to fall asleep, but Irina had given me clear instructions — to behave as usual."""
text36485;"""Which meant not skipping classes without a good reason."""
text36486;"""A hangover could be one, but I simply didn't have enough time yesterday to reach that point."""
text36487;"""Wobbling and grasping at the walls, I managed to walk to the kitchen."""
text36488;"""Coffee would be nice… <w>But I'd never liked it, so I never had any at home."""
text36489;"""I only had tea and aspirin."""
text36490;"""Surprisingly, my head didn't ache."""
text36491;"""I sat down on a chair and came to my senses only a minute later — I had been staring thoughtlessly in front of me."""
text36492;"""Complete exhaustion…"""
text36493;"""Maybe not coffee, but I definitely had alcohol!"""
text36494;"""Just a couple glasses would make me sleep like a log!"""
text36495;"""Irina's furious expression surfaced in my mind."""
text36496;"""Good thing she believed me…"""
text36497;"""Although she didn't want to! <w>She thought I was hiding something, lying to her…"""
text36498;"""God, was this really happening?"""
text36499;"""I pinched myself until I bled."""
text36500;"""Nope, not a dream."""
text36501;"""Somehow, hot tea brought me to my senses — was it time to prepare for school?"""
text36502;"""Although I didn't really have anything to prepare — my homework wasn't done, and I had no idea what classes I was even supposed to have today."""
text36503;"""…"""
text36504;"""Days were becoming shorter — it would've already been light outside at this hour a week ago."""
text36505;"""I was slowly walking the familiar route, occasionally looking over my shoulder."""
text36506;"""But not too obviously – someone could be watching me.<w> Someone probably was — that's what Irina had said."""
text36507;"""So the KGB were around the corner, there were Corporation goons behind the fence, and Japanese counter-intelligence in the bushes?"""
text36508;"""I smirked despite myself."""
text36509;"""People say you can find a positive side to any situation."""
text36510;"""I had once started to write a novel, then dropped it…"""
text36511;"""It was about love, sure, but what would stop me from adding a detective subplot?"""
text36512;"""Well, here is something <i>positive</i> about a poor student becoming prey to the powers that be."""
text36513;"""A Soviet-Japanese student. <w>Like a mini <note=note132>Tom Clancy</note>!"""
text36514;"""Except I didn't have a submarine to give to Americans and thus escape..."""
text36515;"""…"""
text36516;"""I walked into the classroom and sat behind my desk."""
text36517;"""Was I the first in class today? <w>Probably for the first time in my life!"""
text36518;"""It wouldn't take long for me to start volunteering to go to the blackboard, get straight A's, and hang myself in the hall of fame."""
text36519;"""Unless, of course, someone would hang me first in a less crowded place…"""
text36520;"""A head of red hair appeared in the doorway."""
text36521;"""Niko-kun… Are you here?"""
text36522;"""Imagine that!"""
text36523;"""I responded loudly."""
text36524;"""Why are you sneaking around? Nobody's here yet."""
text36525;"""Oh, yeah, sorry."""
text36526;"""Himitsu laughed and walked to my desk."""
text36527;"""You weren't home this morning…"""
text36528;"""Yeah, I couldn't sleep and decided to go to school early."""
text36529;"""Good!"""
text36530;"""She smiled cutely."""
text36531;"""Good that you decided not to skip classes."""
text36532;"""Me, skipping? I would never do that! I'm determined to become a straight A student and get into the top 10!"""
text36533;"""You're, uh, probably exaggerating…"""
text36534;"""Fine, the top 20 then!"""
text36535;"""Himitsu took a little parcel out of her backpack."""
text36536;"""Here — bento!"""
text36537;"""Thank you…"""
text36538;"""I was truly moved."""
text36539;"""Whatever happened in my life, only Himitsu's feelings towards me remained the same."""
text36540;"""Feelings I neither appreciated nor deserved…"""
text36541;"""I wondered what would've happened if back then I… <w>No, I didn't want to know! <w>Not at all!"""
text36542;"""Are you okay? You look a bit weird today."""
text36543;"""I told you, didn't sleep well."""
text36544;"""Himitsu looked at me suspiciously but clearly couldn't find a reason to pry further."""
text36545;"""Well, alright. Are we going home together?"""
text36546;"""What about lunch?"""
text36547;"""I can't make it this time, sorry. Have something to do with my classmates."""
text36548;"""Well, alright. See you then!"""
text36549;"""See you!"""
text36550;"""She smiled genuinely again and walked away."""
text36551;"""What did I even need a Catherine for?"""
text36552;"""Students gradually started to fill the classroom."""
text36553;"""Many of them gave me surprised looks. Had they not expected to see Anokhin this early, or at all?"""
text36554;"""Paying no attention to anyone in his path, Kyosuke breezed into the classroom and started to cheerfully greet all of the guys."""
text36555;"""Michael calmly sat behind his desk and opened one of his books."""
text36556;"""I thought that I should probably ask him at some point what it is he reads all the time."""
text36557;"""I was constantly looking at the clock — there were just a few minutes left before the bell, but…"""
text36558;"""And here came Catherine."""
text36559;"""She passed by, saying nothing but a short:"""
text36560;"""Hi."""
text36561;"""I couldn't say she looked normal — I didn't even know what <i>normal</i> was for her anymore and what wasn't!"""
text36562;"""I didn't know anything about her, didn't know <i>her</i>!"""
text36563;"""The conversation with Irina and this whole spy thriller business shifted my mind away from Catherine and my never-ending romantic indecision."""
text36564;"""But I knew perfectly well that the main source of agitation for me was not the note itself but the fact that Katya had been the one to write it."""
text36565;"""Of course, there was a chances she'd written it with good intentions — she might have wanted to warn me about something."""
text36566;"""But really, it was like we were playing a goddamn game of charades!"""
text36567;"""The lesson seemed to last forever. I wasn't listening to the teacher at all, focused on my own thoughts."""
text36568;"""I had to decide what to do from now on: keep my head down and act normally as per Irina's advice — or try to find something out as per common sense."""
text36569;"""Maybe I was just a student, but I didn't want to trust other people with the right to determine my destiny like a cow on a farm!"""
text36570;"""If I was lucky, the BB gun would break, and I'd be allowed a couple extra days of grazing!"""
text36571;"""Or maybe they'd handle me the traditional way — knocked out with a sledgehammer…"""
text36572;"""And though I had no one to ask about the KGB, there was someone other than Ellie I could ask about the Corporation."""
text36573;"""During lunch, I approached Michael and offered to eat together with him."""
text36574;"""Great, let's go!"""
text36575;"""Kyosuke had been hovering nearby, apparently waiting for the right moment."""
text36576;"""You know, we have something to discuss."""
text36577;"""He looked at me with surprise."""
text36578;"""Adult stuff, not anime — you wouldn't understand."""
text36579;"""Screw you!"""
text36580;"""Michael didn't react to my somewhat strange behavior in any way."""
text36581;"""…"""
text36582;"""I found a spot behind a vacant table, put Himitsu's bento in front of me, and waited for Michael."""
text36583;"""Soon he returned with a tray in his hands and took the seat opposite from me."""
text36584;"""Pretty quick today…"""
text36585;"""Yes, almost no queue."""
text36586;"""Lucky you."""
text36587;"""He said calmly, pointing at my bento."""
text36588;"""Yeah, happens…"""
text36589;"""I grinned like an idiot."""
text36590;"""The canteen was too noisy, so I proposed we finished our food quick and went up to the roof."""
text36591;"""How was your weekend?"""
text36592;"""Not quite as planned."""
text36593;"""What happened?"""
text36594;"""Movies."""
text36595;"""He replied briefly."""
text36596;"""Oh yeah, sorry…"""
text36597;"""I get it — you must be having a lot of problems."""
text36598;"""What makes you think that?"""
text36599;"""It's pretty obvious."""
text36600;"""Obvious, is it? I'm like an open book to you!"""
text36601;"""So, what do you want to talk about? You didn't invite Kyosuke. Something serious?"""
text36602;"""I still hadn't decided whether I could trust Michael, and if I did, then to what extent."""
text36603;"""Of course, telling him the <i>whole</i> truth would be a mistake, but if I wanted his help, I had to at least give him a general idea of the situation."""
text36604;"""Your father's work is related to Kobayashi Corporation, right?"""
text36605;"""I'd say his company is just a business partner."""
text36606;"""What do they even do in this Corporation? What kind of business?"""
text36607;"""Michael looked surprised."""
text36608;"""What kind? All kinds. It's a transnational company, remember? They work with virtually everything, from stuffed animals to satellites."""
text36609;"""Well, that was already clear."""
text36610;"""Okay, what does your father's company do?"""
text36611;"""Construction."""
text36612;"""What kind?"""
text36613;"""Civil construction."""
text36614;"""That was close, but not quite it…"""
text36615;"""I doubted my parents were killed over a poorly designed bridge."""
text36616;"""Got it, thanks."""
text36617;"""Should I even ask why you're interested?"""
text36618;"""Probably not."""
text36619;"""I can ask my father something if you want."""
text36620;"""…"""
text36621;"""How was I supposed to I respond to that?"""
text36622;"""If what Michael said was true, it was unlikely that his father was connected to the Corporation's shady dealings."""
text36623;"""No need. I don't think it will help me much."""
text36624;"""Nick, if you're involved in something dangerous, it might be better to talk to…"""
text36625;"""He went silent for a second, remembering my family situation."""
text36626;"""An adult?"""
text36627;"""Yeah, right! Adults haven't helped me much lately."""
text36628;"""In fact, <i>adults</i> had dragged me into this!"""
text36629;"""I hope you know what you're doing."""
text36630;"""Me too."""
text36631;"""With the conversation seemingly over, Michael was about to return to our classroom."""
text36632;"""I'll hang around a bit longer, you go ahead."""
text36633;"""Sure."""
text36634;"""He shrugged."""
text36635;"""I wondered where Catherine had her lunch. <w>I never saw her with a bento and didn't recall her ever cooking herself."""
text36636;"""I started to feel sleepy again. Luckily, the canteen had coffee."""
text36637;"""A few gulps of the nasty, sour swill woke me up in an instant."""
text36638;"""Just like Japanese people had a low tolerance for alcohol, I had relatively low tolerance for caffeine."""
text36639;"""My heart was beating so hard it felt like I'd just run a 100 metre dash."""
text36640;"""Walking through the school corridors, I felt almost safe."""
text36641;"""After all, this place had too many people to…"""
text36642;"""To what? <w>Irina had told me that a resource that possesses information is a valuable resource."""
text36643;"""Therefore, it would be worthwhile to increase my value — and hence my chance of survival — by obtaining information!"""
text36644;"""…"""
text36645;"""I returned to the classroom and was interrogated by Kyosuke almost immediately."""
text36646;"""So?"""
text36647;"""What?"""
text36648;"""How did the lunch go?"""
text36649;"""Fine."""
text36650;"""Good for you!"""
text36651;"""He made an annoyed face, clearly expecting me to apologize or, at least, feel guilty."""
text36652;"""Let's talk about this another time, okay?"""
text36653;"""…"""
text36654;"""For the rest of the day, I could only think about one thing."""
text36655;"""To be more precise, about a number of things that had recently brought <i>variety</i> into my life."""
text36656;"""\""May you live in interesting times!\"", was it?"""
text36657;"""I felt uncomfortable knowing that Catherine was sitting behind me."""
text36658;"""What if she was staring at my back all the time?"""
text36659;"""What was she thinking about, what was she doing?"""
text36660;"""Maybe she was writing another note?"""
text36661;"""Drinking that coffee was a mistake — I could've slept during class."""
text36662;"""I doubted anyone would try to wake me up: such behavior was the norm for Nikolai Anokhin and fighting it was as effective as jousting windmills."""
text36663;"""Irina told me to behave <i>normally</i>."""
text36664;"""If only I knew where the border of <i>normalcy</i> was drawn…"""
text36665;"""Class was finally over."""
text36666;"""The crowd at the shoe lockers was full of happy chatter: some were about to go to the movies, some to karaoke, and some on dates."""
text36667;"""I changed my shoes and walked into the schoolyard, stopped for a minute, and felt infinitely alone as I watched students quickly walk past, paying zero attention to me."""
text36668;"""Like a yellow leaf in a river, caught on a piece of wood."""
text36669;"""But I wasn't the only one in this position — Catherine was standing at the gates…<w> Clearly waiting for someone with a bored expression on her face."""
text36670;"""She wasn't looking in my direction, but I wasn't moving either."""
text36671;"""Simply because I didn't know what to say, not to mention I outright hadn't slept in two nights and didn't have the mental energy to come up with something sensible to start a conversation with."""
text36672;"""It seemed like something like this had already happened before — when I ran after her, caught her by the hand, and she threatened to scream…"""
text36673;"""It felt like that moment had happened way over a week ago."""
text36674;"""Though I wasn't just afraid to approach her, I feared even to appear in her line of sight."""
text36675;"""Was I afraid she'd notice me?<w> Was I afraid to simply walk out of the school gates, leave that <i>safe</i> territory?"""
text36676;"""Finally, a car stopped near Catherine, and she got in."""
text36677;"""Since when was Catherine picked up from school like <i>that</i>, I wondered."""
text36678;"""Not everyone here had a personal driver."""
text36679;"""I couldn't remember Mrs Winters doing anything like that before."""
text36680;"""Could she be in danger too?"""
text36681;"""Niko-kun!"""
text36682;"""Himitsu's cheerful voice came from behind me."""
text36683;"""I flinched in surprise and turned around."""
text36684;"""How was the bento?"""
text36685;"""She asked, running up to me."""
text36686;"""Very good, thanks!"""
text36687;"""I wouldn't be able to say what had been in it even if my life depended on it."""
text36688;"""It definitely had some rice though…"""
text36689;"""How was your day?"""
text36690;"""Very tiring…"""
text36691;"""I wondered if she saw me stand there, staring at Catherine."""
text36692;"""What about you?"""
text36693;"""Wonderful! We were getting ready for the school festival! Our class wants to make a café."""
text36694;"""For a second she fell silent, embarrassed."""
text36695;"""Do you think I'd look good in a maid outfit?"""
text36696;"""I'm sure you would..."""
text36697;"""Will you come by? We'll have cupcakes, and shortcakes, and layered cakes, and…"""
text36698;"""I'm already practising cooking them at home. But I'm not letting you try any yet, just in case!"""
text36699;"""Himitsu laughed and now looked absolutely innocent."""
text36700;"""So much so that I found it hard to look at her."""
text36701;"""What's your class gonna do?"""
text36702;"""For the school festival, you mean?"""
text36703;"""As if I knew!"""
text36704;"""We're putting on \""The Prince and the Pauper\""!"""
text36705;"""Really?"""
text36706;"""No."""
text36707;"""Hey!"""
text36708;"""We haven't decided yet. Graduation class, you know — exams and all that."""
text36709;"""I lied."""
text36710;"""Let's go?"""
text36711;"""I took Himitsu by the hand and left the schoolyard, looking straight ahead."""
text36712;"""Niko-kun…"""
text36713;"""She weakly tried to protest, but her hand did not let go of mine."""
text36714;"""…"""
text36715;"""Himitsu kept telling me about her class' plans for the school festival, but I wasn't really listening."""
text36716;"""Why <i>was</i> Catherine picked up by a car?<w> Was that a one-time thing, or would this happen always from now on?"""
text36717;"""She couldn't not have noticed that yesterday I was basically in panic when I fled her apartment!"""
text36718;"""Katya was a smart girl and would probably draw the right conclusions."""
text36719;"""To add to that, whatever reason she had to leave the note, Catherine clearly knew more than I."""
text36720;"""Hello! Earth to Niko-kun!"""
text36721;"""Huh? What?"""
text36722;"""You're sleeping on your feet."""
text36723;"""Himitsu said kindly."""
text36724;"""That's exactly it."""
text36725;"""Maybe you should've stayed home today after all?"""
text36726;"""Yeah, tell that to Irina…"""
text36727;"""Nope, definitely shouldn't have! Definitely not today!"""
text36728;"""Why not?"""
text36729;"""I looked at Himitsu's beautiful, surprised face and knew what I had to do."""
text36730;"""I had to tell her what had happened yesterday."""
text36731;"""Because she too could be in danger."""
text36732;"""Because she was the only person in the whole wide world whom I could trust!"""
text36733;"""I love you!"""
text36734;"""I said seriously."""
text36735;"""She stopped and froze with an expression of utter shock on her face."""
text36736;"""Niko… kun…"""
text36737;"""We need to talk. I need to tell you something important!"""
text36738;"""Himitsu's expression saddened."""
text36739;"""Strange, I was sure she'd be glad about the confession."""
text36740;"""Why do you say this now? It's not true…"""
text36741;"""Let's go! We'll talk at home."""
text36742;"""She followed me limply, automatically, her head cast down."""
text36743;"""We were silently sitting in the kitchen, avoiding each other's eyes."""
text36744;"""What I had said about love… <w>Was it really necessary?"""
text36745;"""Some words can't be taken back!"""
text36746;"""And I was sure Himitsu knew full well that I wasn't telling the truth."""
text36747;"""At least that my words meant something different from what she wanted."""
text36748;"""But let that be a noble lie!"""
text36749;"""And I was about to tell her the truth here and now! <w>The truth that she had to know, the truth that was currently more important."""
text36750;"""Alright, so…"""
text36751;"""I took a deep breath, stood up from the chair, and walked from one end of the kitchen to another."""
text36752;"""Promise you won't interrupt!"""
text36753;"""Himitsu showed no reaction to my words."""
text36754;"""So, it all started about a week ago. With Catherine's return, yes… But it's not only and not mainly about her."""
text36755;"""The same day, in the evening, I found a note at my door. It asked me to be careful, said I was in danger because of my parents' work."""
text36756;"""After these words, she livened up and gave me an uncomprehending look."""
text36757;"""Wait a second…"""
text36758;"""I rushed to my room, took the note from a cabinet, returned to the kitchen and gave it to Himitsu."""
text36759;"""See, it's not a joke!"""
text36760;"""Niko-kun…"""
text36761;"""Wait, don't interrupt!"""
text36762;"""I was very agitated and wasn't looking at her, instead walking to the doors to the garden."""
text36763;"""But there's more. The next day, I got a phone call in Russian and was told to be careful."""
text36764;"""Then I was followed in the city."""
text36765;"""Then I was followed in the city, I think."""
text36766;"""And finally, yesterday I was interrogated by a Soviet agent. A KGB agent. KGB, understand?"""
text36767;"""I paused."""
text36768;"""Himitsu didn't react, just kept looking at me, but in addition to surprise, her eyes now also expressed worry and pity."""
text36769;"""She said my parents didn't die by chance, that it wasn't an accident!"""
text36770;"""They were killed…"""
text36771;"""But why...?"""
text36772;"""She uttered in a strained voice."""
text36773;"""Because of their work for Kobayashi Corporation! For that damned company!"""
text36774;"""And she also warned that I'd be watched by… Well, everyone who possibly can!"""
text36775;"""I giggled nervously."""
text36776;"""Russians, Japanese, probably even Americans!"""
text36777;"""Americans?"""
text36778;"""Why not? They've got like a constant beef with the USSR!"""
text36779;"""Although that was just my own speculation."""
text36780;"""Himitsu once again turned the note in her hands, studying it carefully."""
text36781;"""Did <i>they</i> write it?"""
text36782;"""N-no… I don't know."""
text36783;"""That was probably enough truth for today."""
text36784;"""Considering her and Catherine's relationship, it wasn't hard to imagine that if I said the note was from the latter, she'd go for a knife…"""
text36785;"""But the call was definitely made by someone from the KGB. That's what the agent said."""
text36786;"""And what do they want from you?"""
text36787;"""Nothing, as she said. They want to protect me from the Japanese, from Kobayashi Corporation. They said they think I have some kind of information, data passed on by my father."""
text36788;"""Do you?"""
text36789;"""Himitsu said seriously."""
text36790;"""No! If I did, I would've given it all to them right away and kept on living peacefully!"""
text36791;"""A long silence followed."""
text36792;"""I was desperately waiting for Himitsu's reaction, but she wouldn't say anything, just sat there, her feet on the chair, her arms around her knees, her face hidden behind them."""
text36793;"""Say something, please!"""
text36794;"""Suddenly, she jumped off of the chair, ran up to me, and embraced me firmly, pushing her whole body up against mine."""
text36795;"""Niko-kun, forgive me, please!"""
text36796;"""Himitsu was bawling."""
text36797;"""Sunshine, what for? You didn't do anything wrong!"""
text36798;"""No! I… I didn't know that something like this happened to you…"""
text36799;"""I… I was acting so terribly! I was only thinking about myself!"""
text36800;"""No! Not at all!"""
text36801;"""Niko-kun, I'm sorry!"""
text36802;"""For a good while, we just stood there, wordless, drowning in each other's embrace."""
text36803;"""Finally, I took Himitsu by the shoulders and gently pushed her away."""
text36804;"""The most important thing you should know is that I don't want to involve you!"""
text36805;"""It's just… The KGB, the Corporation… Anything could happen."""
text36806;"""I'll help you!"""
text36807;"""She said resolutely."""
text36808;"""No! Absolutely not!"""
text36809;"""I raised my voice."""
text36810;"""That KGB woman told me not to show any sign that I might know something. Told me to act normally. And that's what we're going to do. Got it?"""
text36811;"""Himitsu pursed her lips unhappily but conceded:"""
text36812;"""Fine."""
text36813;"""But I won't be able to sleep well at night anymore…"""
text36814;"""Yeah, well… <w>I'm not saying that we… that I'm in no danger, but she is right about one thing — the Japanese need something from me. And they'll leave me alone when they realize I don't have it."""
text36815;"""If you think so…"""
text36816;"""Himitsu smiled with some effort."""
text36817;"""She might've read more romance novels than mysteries, but I wasn't as naïve — unwanted witnesses get disposed of."""
text36818;"""And when they realize I didn't have the information they needed, they would quickly figure out that I knew a lot of <i>unwanted</i> things about the Corporation."""
text36819;"""And now I really need to get some sleep…"""
text36820;"""I'm not leaving!"""
text36821;"""She protested."""
text36822;"""Remember what I told you? Act normally! Don't arouse suspicion!"""
text36823;"""But Niko-kun…"""
text36824;"""No buts!"""
text36825;"""For a little while, Himitsu fidgeted in place."""
text36826;"""Fine… But be careful!"""
text36827;"""Careful where, at home? What am I at risk of here? Burning myself with hot water or slipping in the bathroom?"""
text36828;"""I grinned."""
text36829;"""Himitsu didn't react. She stepped close to me and said:"""
text36830;"""And also…"""
text36831;"""She rose on her tiptoes, pulled me close, and gave me a firm kiss."""
text36832;"""I responded to it but meekly, feigning surprise."""
text36833;"""For luck!"""
text36834;"""We all could use some…"""
text36835;"""Himitsu left, while I remained in the kitchen, deliriously staring at the note on the table."""
text36836;"""I could use some sleep, but my exhaustion seemed to have passed that threshold where it unlocked a second wind."""
text36837;"""Where you're outwardly buoyant and full of vigor, but your mind can barely function."""
text36838;"""So I was simply staring into space, my mouth open, having forgotten where I was and what was happening."""
text36839;"""But the talk with Himitsu left behind a pressing feeling of understatement and uncertainty."""
text36840;"""Was I really, like a cow in a butchery, going to wait and see what fate awaited me?!"""
text36841;"""And if only it was me alone…"""
text36842;"""But who could help me now? <w>Who knew about my parents' work?"""
text36843;"""Ichinose-san — the answer presented itself."""
text36844;"""The time for niceties had passed. If need be, I was ready to beat the information out of him!"""
text36845;"""…"""
text36846;"""Except nobody picked up the phone."""
text36847;"""I waited for at least a minute and received nothing but dial tones in response."""
text36848;"""Perhaps he wasn't home...?"""
text36849;"""I called again and again."""
text36850;"""Finally, an agitated female voice came from the receiver:"""
text36851;"""Ichinose household."""
text36852;"""Hello… I need to talk to your husband."""
text36853;"""My husband…"""
text36854;"""The woman was clearly nervous."""
text36855;"""Who are you?"""
text36856;"""I'm an… acquaintance."""
text36857;"""He… he's not here."""
text36858;"""When will he be back?"""
text36859;"""He hasn't been home for several days! Do you know where my husband is?!"""
text36860;"""She shouted."""
text36861;"""I quickly hung up the phone."""
text36862;"""So they got to him too!"""
text36863;"""Well, that was to be expected."""
text36864;"""My parents were killed, that Akira Shinji supposedly died from a heart attack, Ichinose hadn't come back home in several days."""
text36865;"""Was the Corporation really getting rid of witnesses?"""
text36866;"""In that case, maybe it was a good thing I didn't know anything. Anyone who actually did didn't seem to live long…"""
text36867;"""And what was the difference between a human and a resource for <i>them</i>?"""
text36868;"""I wanted to sleep so badly that no strength remained to worry about anything else."""
text36869;"""With effort, I reached my room and fell onto the bed."""
text36870;"""…"""
text36871;"""I dreamed of having broken an arm. That instead of a plaster, I was just given a splint that constantly threatened to slip off."""
text36872;"""It also turned out that the arm was fine — I had been brazenly tricked by the hospital."""
text36873;"""Then Kyosuke came and started to loudly laugh at me."""
text36874;"""And finally, the phone rang."""
text36875;"""I walked to it and answered, and heard Ichinose-san's voice in the receiver: \""Hello! Nikolai, is that you? What are you doing there?\"""""
text36876;"""…"""
text36877;"""But it wasn't the phone — it was the doorbell."""
text36878;"""Barely able to find my way around, I dragged myself out of bed and, still half asleep, went on to open the door."""
text36879;"""I found a young man wearing a uniform at my doorstep."""
text36880;"""Are you Anokhin Nikolai?"""
text36881;"""Well, yeah…"""
text36882;"""He rummaged through his satchel and pulled out a small envelope."""
text36883;"""A tiny one, actually. I didn't know they made them that small."""
text36884;"""Sign here!"""
text36885;"""He extended a clipboard to me with a piece of paper attached to it."""
text36886;"""Right here."""
text36887;"""I casually whipped out my scribble and smirked:"""
text36888;"""Should I bring you <note=note133>the inkan</note> too?"""
text36889;"""The courier gave me a weird look, bowed deeply, and bid farewell:"""
text36890;"""Have a good evening!"""
text36891;"""In reality, I always used simple <note=note134>katakana</note> for my signature, which did, of course, create some problems in the legal sense, but was generally acceptable for a foreigner."""
text36892;"""The realization of what had happened didn't come right away."""
text36893;"""I returned to my room and only then realized that I didn't usually receive letters, especially ones delivered by a courier!"""
text36894;"""I hastily ripped the envelope open and took out a small folded piece of paper, a few sentences written on it:"""
text36895;"""\""Nikolai, we need to talk, urgently. Come to the waterfront after midnight and make sure you're not followed. We'll meet on the bridge. Ichinose.\"""""
text36896;"""I don't believe it…"""
text36897;"""I re-read the note several times."""
text36898;"""What if it was a trap?"""
text36899;"""No, it seemed too complicated for people with <i>that</i> kind of power."""
text36900;"""For instance, I was home alone right now (and always, really). What stopped them from kidnapping or killing me?"""
text36901;"""And the note was delivered right after my call to Ichinose!<w> At midnight…"""
text36902;"""What was even the time?<w> I looked at the clock — it showed a few minutes past eleven."""
text36903;"""It wouldn't take me more than an hour to reach the waterfront…"""
text36904;"""I almost immediately decided that I would go to the meeting, simply trusting my instincts and logic."""
text36905;"""Now I just had to decide what to do about the surveillance."""
text36906;"""Ichinose didn't even have to warn me."""
text36907;"""Going out somewhere at almost midnight was definitely not normal for me!"""
text36908;"""But if I were to do it carefully…"""
text36909;"""For some reason, I was confident that even if I was being watched, it wasn't the same way they'd watch James Bond or something."""
text36910;"""From the street, everything would look as if I had already gone to sleep!"""
text36911;"""I turned off the light, sat down on the bed, and waited, holding my breath and listening in to the sounds coming from the street."""
text36912;"""Nothing…"""
text36913;"""Or, well, nothing unusual."""
text36914;"""The first step is the hardest in situations like this."""
text36915;"""Then instincts take over."""
text36916;"""I took a few deep breaths, closed my eyes, and focused on my breathing."""
text36917;"""Time to go."""
text36918;"""The door silently opened and immediately closed, while I ducked into the garden."""
text36919;"""I crept to the fence."""
text36920;"""A few of the planks weren't nailed well and were easy to move aside."""
text36921;"""A moment later, I was in the alley behind the house."""
text36922;"""It didn't even have any lamp posts, being just a narrow passage between two plots of land."""
text36923;"""A couple minutes later I was on my way to the station, trying to avoid my usual route."""
text36924;"""…"""
text36925;"""Only as I approached the station did I look back for the first time."""
text36926;"""If my surveillants <i>had</i> noticed me, they'd follow me to the end. Giving them a reason to believe they'd been found wouldn't do me any good."""
text36927;"""If not, then all the better."""
text36928;"""But I had reason to believe that my plan had worked. <w>At least at this stage."""
text36929;"""I boarded the train and looked out onto the platform. All I could see were tired Japanese on their way back home after a hard day of work."""
text36930;"""…"""
text36931;"""The Tokyo suburb welcomed me coldly with a chilly ocean breeze."""
text36932;"""I was in a shopping district near a port."""
text36933;"""It was already late, so most of the stores were closed."""
text36934;"""Why did Ichinose choose this place, I wondered."""
text36935;"""The bridge in question was visible in the darkness a couple hundred meters away from the station."""
text36936;"""I reached the place in a few minutes, but at first glance, it appeared to be empty."""
text36937;"""Nikolai…"""
text36938;"""I heard the familiar voice, and Ichinose-san appeared out of the shadows."""
text36939;"""Were you followed?"""
text36940;"""No."""
text36941;"""Are you sure?"""
text36942;"""He looked pretty calm, which seemed strange to me."""
text36943;"""Yes, absolutely."""
text36944;"""Good… Good… I'm sorry, Nikolai. I'm sorry…"""
text36945;"""What for?"""
text36946;"""I asked with surprise."""
text36947;"""For my cowardice, for getting cold feet. See what's come out of it?"""
text36948;"""He smiled sadly and immediately continued:"""
text36949;"""As they say, \""First they came for the Communists...\"""""
text36950;"""What are you talking about?"""
text36951;"""I thought that if I kept silent, they would leave me alone, but things turned out very differently."""
text36952;"""Ichinose let out a heavy sigh and lit up a cigarette."""
text36953;"""Thank God I was long prepared for it!"""
text36954;"""I called your house, and your wife said you've been missing for several days."""
text36955;"""Yes, that's true. Our phone is wiretapped, and I'm in hiding. My wife informed me that someone had called and I sent a courier with the note."""
text36956;"""But… How did you know it was me?"""
text36957;"""Сaller display — heard of it?"""
text36958;"""No, to be honest…"""
text36959;"""I didn't even know where to start asking questions."""
text36960;"""It had to happen, sooner or later. After we had been kicked out of the Project, it was inevitable."""
text36961;"""The Project?"""
text36962;"""The Project is what your father and I worked on at Kobayashi Corporation."""
text36963;"""What is this then?"""
text36964;"""He raised his tired eyes to me."""
text36965;"""I can't explain it in brief, and you wouldn't understand."""
text36966;"""I'll do my best! After all, my parents died because of this <i>project</i>…"""
text36967;"""I responded confidently."""
text36968;"""I'd be glad to tell you, but it's not that simple. Each one of us was responsible for our own part of the research and development."""
text36969;"""I was a physicist and mostly worked on theoretical calculations. They can have a lot of applications."""
text36970;"""And what about my father?"""
text36971;"""He was a rocket engineer."""
text36972;"""Is that so…"""
text36973;"""I drawled."""
text36974;"""And here I had always thought he built bridges…"""
text36975;"""And the main problem is that we knew as little about the work of other departments as was possible. It was their way of preserving secrecy."""
text36976;"""I only talked to your father about work-related matters and only when it was absolutely necessary."""
text36977;"""What kind of work-related matters?"""
text36978;"""You wouldn't understand."""
text36979;"""He sighed."""
text36980;"""Ichinose-san, I'm neck deep in this shit, and I want to get out. I'm not about to back down now!"""
text36981;"""You don't know what you're talking about, Nikolai! Even if I could tell you more, it would greatly endanger you and everyone you hold dear!"""
text36982;"""<i>Everyone you hold dear</i>…"""
text36983;"""Himitsu's tearful face immediately came to mind."""
text36984;"""Look at me!"""
text36985;"""Ichinose grinned."""
text36986;"""I've been long ready that someone would come for me, so I ran at the first sign of danger."""
text36987;"""Are you… are you ready to do the same?"""
text36988;"""I… no… I don't know."""
text36989;"""He was definitely right about something."""
text36990;"""And until I figured out what the difference was between a <i>resource</i> and a <i>human</i>…"""
text36991;"""But my father's work wasn't the only question on my agenda tonight."""
text36992;"""Do you know someone with the surname Winters? An American."""
text36993;"""Hm…"""
text36994;"""Ichinose thought a moment."""
text36995;"""Who is that? How are you connected?"""
text36996;"""Do you know her or not?"""
text36997;"""I've heard the name Winters. But I think it belonged to an adult woman."""
text36998;"""And how is she connected to your Project?"""
text36999;"""I don't think she has any direct connection to the scientific part of the project, but she could be representing the American side…"""
text37000;"""American? What <i>American side</i>, Ichinose-san?!"""
text37001;"""A terrible guess struck me."""
text37002;"""Did you think it was only the Japanese working on the Project?"""
text37003;"""I didn't think anything!"""
text37004;"""I responded rudely."""
text37005;"""And this Mrs… Does this Mrs Winters have any connection to the death of my parents?"""
text37006;"""He frowned and looked at me carefully over his glasses."""
text37007;"""You're talking as if they were killed."""
text37008;"""Weren't they?"""
text37009;"""Nikolai, I…"""
text37010;"""He cut himself off mid-sentence, let out a heavy sigh, and lowered his eyes."""
text37011;"""I have no proof, but I suspected that the accident wasn't a coincidence!"""
text37012;"""I couldn't tell you since, it was just a guess of mine…"""
text37013;"""That doesn't matter anymore, Ichinose-san! What about Mrs Winters?"""
text37014;"""I don't think so… No."""
text37015;"""But you aren't sure?"""
text37016;"""Nikolai, why are you so interested in this woman? I'm telling you, I've never even seen her, just heard the name."""
text37017;"""It's… a very personal matter."""
text37018;"""Well, I hope you know what you're doing…"""
text37019;"""So Catherine's mother was somehow involved in all of this!"""
text37020;"""But she wasn't to blame for my parents' death."""
text37021;"""That is, if I were to believe Ichinose, who didn't really know much himself."""
text37022;"""But how was all this connected to Catherine's note? <w>Did that mean she knew something too?"""
text37023;"""My entire life was a lie and a theatre of the absurd!"""
text37024;"""My family matters were known best to everyone but myself!"""
text37025;"""Ichinose-san, everything is not that… I need time to digest it all."""
text37026;"""I understand. By the way…"""
text37027;"""He sighed and turned away, clearly bracing himself."""
text37028;"""I haven't told you everything about Akira Shinji. He's not dead."""
text37029;"""I looked at him with a silent question on my face."""
text37030;"""At the time it seemed to me like I was doing the right thing by not telling you the entire truth. Not to mention your phone is wiretapped the same as mine."""
text37031;"""He was taken by people from the Corporation."""
text37032;"""So in a sense, he may as well be dead."""
text37033;"""And this… Akira Shinji? Who was he?"""
text37034;"""Oooh, now he was a big deal in the Project and most likely knew much more than I!"""
text37035;"""Then we need to find him!"""
text37036;"""That won't work. It's Kobayashi Corporation, remember? He could be anywhere."""
text37037;"""Ichinose paused, then continued in a lower voice:"""
text37038;"""He may very well not be alive anymore…"""
text37039;"""But then what should we do next?"""
text37040;"""We?"""
text37041;"""He gave me a somehow fatherly look and said:"""
text37042;"""I plan to keep hiding from the Corporation, and you… better keep far away from it all!"""
text37043;"""Better yet, return to the Union if you can!"""
text37044;"""I… I can't…"""
text37045;"""I can't abandon Himitsu!"""
text37046;"""Not until I was sure that she wasn't involved in any of this. <w>That she wasn't in danger…"""
text37047;"""In that case, I can only remind you to be as careful as possible!"""
text37048;"""I've heard that a little too often lately."""
text37049;"""Perhaps the Corporation will leave you alone when they realize you have nothing to offer. After all, you have no direct connection to the Project."""
text37050;"""Ichinose-san, thank you very much!"""
text37051;"""No need to thank me. I did what was right."""
text37052;"""Will we meet again?"""
text37053;"""He looked annoyed, but only for a moment."""
text37054;"""Here."""
text37055;"""He handed me a small piece of paper with a telephone number written on it."""
text37056;"""Memorize, then throw away or burn the paper — anything so long as you don't keep it. This is the phone number of my nephew. You will need to ask if Agawa-san is at home. You'll be told that you've got the wrong number, and I'll find a way to get in contact with you."""
text37057;"""Ichinose-san, whatever happens, thank you very much!"""
text37058;"""I bowed deeply."""
text37059;"""Alright, enough now!"""
text37060;"""He grinned."""
text37061;"""Be careful on your way home."""
text37062;"""And then he disappeared into the gloom of the Tokyo waterfront."""
text37063;"""…"""
text37064;"""Geez!"""
text37065;"""The next train home would only come early in the morning, so I found a phone booth and called a taxi."""
text37066;"""…"""
text37067;"""The car was making its way through the streets of the sleeping metropolis at a steady pace, and I was trying to digest everything Ichinose had told me."""
text37068;"""But the volume of information, the agitation, the lack of sleep made my brain incapable of anything but recalling separate phrases from our conversation over and over again."""
text37069;"""Each one was important in and of itself but made no sense when put together with the others."""
text37070;"""I got out of the taxi several blocks away from my house and returned the same way — through the alleyway and the hole in the fence."""
text37071;"""…"""
text37072;"""I desperately needed to sleep!"""
text37073;"""Those few hours in the afternoon hadn't helped at all, and I felt totally beat."""
text37074;"""The house was dark and quiet, and so was the street."""
text37075;"""This time of night is the most serene and most mysterious at the same time."""
text37076;"""My inflamed imagination started to project jumping shadows into the corners and rustling noises into the kitchen."""
text37077;"""Tomorrow will be better, tomorrow will be better…"""
text37078;"""I muttered, my head hidden under the blanket."""

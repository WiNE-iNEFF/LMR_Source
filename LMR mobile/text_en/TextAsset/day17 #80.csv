text28877;"""Why do different people like different colors?"""
text28878;"""Freud and Lüscher most definitely had their opinions on that, but I've always struggled to make a clear choice."""
text28879;"""Sometimes, my favorite color could be blue or violet, I used to hate yellow, and my childhood preference was white."""
text28880;"""Of course, there are strictly scientific explanations for the matter, but in our everyday life we're used to more basic interpretations."""
text28881;"""Red symbolizes the unbridled fervor of fire, blue epitomizes the serenity of the clear summer sky, while black reminds us of the dusty shrouds and gloomy vaults of a Gothic church."""
text28882;"""I wasn't sure which colors I would associate with Catherine and Himitsu, but in my memories their smiles used the same pallet."""
text28883;"""The sound of the TV woke me up, and with some effort I blew my nose — the night wind had made it pretty stuffy."""
text28884;"""Due to the uncomfortable position my back hurt, making the awakening even less enjoyable."""
text28885;"""On the screen, chipper and overly smiley, news anchors were wishing a good morning to all the inhabitants of Tokyo."""
text28886;"""They had it easier, of course — these programs are usually pre-recorded, and now they were peacefully sleeping in their cozy beds!"""
text28887;"""Right after the fake smiles and tons of face powder came a cooking show."""
text28888;"""\""Spend just five minutes and make yourself happy with a tasty, healthy breakfast!\"" — a professional chef with more than twenty years of experience was shouting, skilfully filleting fish and slicing vegetables."""
text28889;"""Yeah, right!"""
text28890;"""I wouldn't be able cook anything like that even in three hours, with or without all the ingredients!"""
text28891;"""Although a dead mouse, a couple dozen cockroaches, and some soy sauce would make for an undoubtedly higher protein, though probably not as tasty, meal than the one prepared by that TV chef."""
text28892;"""Having weighed up all the cons and failed to find any pros, I got dressed and walked to school."""
text28893;"""I had no desire to skip classes since I had nothing else to do in the morning."""
text28894;"""By skipping breakfast, I managed to find some time to drop by a shop and buy a couple chocolate bars."""
text28895;"""I wanted to go to my favorite ramen place as well, but after counting the money in my wallet, I abandoned the idea."""
text28896;"""And I still had a week before the end of the month…"""
text28897;"""At school, everything seemed normal: joyful and enthusiastic Kyosuke, Michael with his book, and Catherine who was expressly ignoring my presence."""
text28898;"""Everyone seemed to have forgotten about my behavior yesterday."""
text28899;"""Or were merely pretended to, keeping up appearances."""
text28900;"""In any case, I didn't feel like an exile. <w>No more than usual…"""
text28901;"""Not that anybody ever paid much attention to me."""
text28902;"""I had to admit, I was a little scared of the derogatory looks and whispers behind my back on my way to school."""
text28903;"""But life went on as usual, not noticing me and my <i>problems</i>."""
text28904;"""During the second class, a note landed on my desk."""
text28905;"""\""Come to the roof at lunch\""."""
text28906;"""It was written in Japanese. The handwriting looked familiar, but it definitely wasn't Katya's."""
text28907;"""I was even kind of happy to receive the note, since I was starting to get bored."""
text28908;"""So this is a thing too, huh — now the absence of adrenaline equaled boredom to me!"""
text28909;"""During the long break I went to the roof, waving Kyosuke away as he offered to have lunch together."""
text28910;"""However, there was nobody there."""
text28911;"""Apparently I was too early. <w>Was what I thought as I sat on the bench, preparing to wait for the author of the note."""
text28912;"""The door soon opened, and Kagome jumped into the arms of the unfriendly autumn wind."""
text28913;"""Well yeah, I should've expected that…"""
text28914;"""I muttered."""
text28915;"""What are you mumbling there?"""
text28916;"""Kagome asked in an intimidating tone, coming closer."""
text28917;"""I want to clarify something, just in case: did you write the note?"""
text28918;"""Yes."""
text28919;"""She replied briefly and sat next to me."""
text28920;"""Right!"""
text28921;"""I realized why the handwriting looked familiar to me — Kagome was the class rep and would constantly write things on the blackboard."""
text28922;"""We seem to be meeting each other a bit too often these days."""
text28923;"""You're in no position to make jokes!"""
text28924;"""What else can I do?"""
text28925;"""You're in danger, don't you understand?"""
text28926;"""In danger...?"""
text28927;"""I've managed to uncover something else… The father of your red-headed girlfriend works for Japanese intelligence! And he may be somehow related to my father's disappearance!"""
text28928;"""Goddamit, does everyone actually know more than I do about own my life?!"""
text28929;"""I exclaimed and flung my arms into the air."""
text28930;"""Doesn't seem like it's news to you..."""
text28931;"""She squinted her eyes, but I immediately asked a question:"""
text28932;"""How did you learn that?"""
text28933;"""I have my own sources."""
text28934;"""Kagome responded unsurely, turned away, and shivered from the strong wind."""
text28935;"""Here…"""
text28936;"""I stood up, took my jacket off, and tried to put it over her shoulders."""
text28937;"""What are you doing?!"""
text28938;"""She immediately jumped up from the bench and ran a few feet away."""
text28939;"""Just trying to act like a gentleman. Since you trust me…"""
text28940;"""I mean, you've told me so much important information already."""
text28941;"""Kagome calmed down a bit but didn't come closer."""
text28942;"""It's because I still hope that you're a reasonable guy. Besides, we're in a similar situation, so I want to believe that you'll act reasonably!"""
text28943;"""I have to say though that so far you've been as useful as a dug-up corpse!"""
text28944;"""Well, I'm sorry for not knowing anything else!"""
text28945;"""And at this point it was mostly the truth!"""
text28946;"""And why do you think I should blindly trust you?"""
text28947;"""Because I have no reason to lie to you! I'm just looking for my father!"""
text28948;"""I didn't reply, but her words made me feel guilty."""
text28949;"""After all, Kagome, despite her rather complicated personality, had opened up to me and relied on me to some extent."""
text28950;"""You're right, sorry… Is there anything else you know? And how do you even know about Himitsu's father?"""
text28951;"""I've told you enough already! And you seem completely unsurprised by it."""
text28952;"""I'm just tired of surprises."""
text28953;"""I smiled idiotically."""
text28954;"""But I would like to know more about your sources."""
text28955;"""Tit for tat!"""
text28956;"""I have nothing to offer in return, it's not like this is a card game! If you were me, wouldn't you want to know everything?"""
text28957;"""Are you so sure it's easier to <i>be you</i> than me?"""
text28958;"""No, but that doesn't change anything."""
text28959;"""Unlike you, I'm trying to do something!"""
text28960;"""I've already told you everything I know! And how I found out isn't important!"""
text28961;"""Just for your information, a <i>one-sided<i> relationship like this can't last long."""
text28962;"""Oh, so we have a relationship now?"""
text28963;"""Asshole!"""
text28964;"""Kagome hissed, and I was left alone."""
text28965;"""I seemed to remember that Himitsu once said I should change my attitude toward other people."""
text28966;"""And even though I'd started to behave differently with her (and, maybe, to some extent, with Catherine), others remained of as little interest to me as before."""
text28967;"""But Iwamura could've become a useful ally."""
text28968;"""Next time (if there was a next time) I'd have to treat her with more respect!"""
text28969;"""I came across Michael at the entrance to the classroom."""
text28970;"""He looked at me coldly but said nothing."""
text28971;"""It's not like he had to say anthing: no one would show it openly, but everyone (except probably Kyosuke) considered me a social pariah."""
text28972;"""Or maybe I'd just become a persona non grata, since I'd never really tried to change my caste, deeming it impossible."""
text28973;"""There was absolutely no way I could keep being in <i>their</i> company."""
text28974;"""I quickly packed my bag, and, with my eyes lowered, walked out of the classroom."""
text28975;"""The bell reached me in the schoolyard, and deep inside I felt sad and, for some reason, even disgusted."""
text28976;"""I guess I had never really given thought to the fact that on weekday afternoons the streets were populated by totally different people than in the evenings."""
text28977;"""Children and teenagers were studying, while adults were mostly at work."""
text28978;"""But pensioners of all ages, mothers with their strollers, all kinds of couriers and delivery boys сrawled out of their homes between nine and six o'clock to enjoy the still-warm autumn sun."""
text28979;"""Soon they would be replaced by office workers in their identical grey suits, children who couldn't wait to have some fun, and exhausted factory workers."""
text28980;"""But for now Tokyo belonged fully to that nice, motley crowd."""
text28981;"""I slowed down to catch a few more smiles from strangers passing by — they had a calming effect on me."""
text28982;"""In the end, some people were capable of not only drowning in their problems but also bringing some happiness in the world, sharing their good mood with others."""
text28983;"""Even if in reality things were very different, and it was just a sign of politeness…"""
text28984;"""I came home, kicked off my boots and walked into the kitchen."""
text28985;"""The TV was still on, showing a program for housewives. <w>\""Household Secrets\""."""
text28986;"""Himitsu probably watched it often…"""
text28987;"""At first, I thought the ring of the doorbell was a part of the show, but I quickly realized that wasn't the case and opened the door."""
text28988;"""Ryunosuke-san was standing at my doorstep."""
text28989;"""Physically fit, as focused as always, with a cold look in his eyes and abrupt, military, precise gestures."""
text28990;"""How come I never figured out he wasn't just a simple government employeer...?"""
text28991;"""Ryunosuke-san…"""
text28992;"""I greeted him briefly and slightly lowered my head."""
text28993;"""May I come in?"""
text28994;"""Sure."""
text28995;"""I walked him to the kitchen and offered a chair."""
text28996;"""Nikolai, I respect you, so I'm not going to pretend or put on an act here. I think you have long realized what's going on."""
text28997;"""You've become very interesting to the KGB lately — that explains a lot"""
text28998;"""I froze in place."""
text28999;"""I hoped he didn't know I had eavesdropped on him in the village."""
text29000;"""I'm not aware how much you know, but it is in your best interest to tell me everything here and now."""
text29001;"""What I know…"""
text29002;"""I said quietly."""
text29003;"""So this was the person I'd known half my life."""
text29004;"""Not only had he been he lying abjectly to my parents and me for so many years, he'd also managed to drag his own daughter into this!"""
text29005;"""Oh, I know enough! Let me tell you a story…"""
text29006;"""About a nice neighbor who pretends to be a family friend. About how he is willing, without hesitation, to betray anyone on command."""
text29007;"""For him, the ends justify any means! And there are no moral boundaries — he'll even use his own daughter to accomplish his goals!"""
text29008;"""Any means, right, Ryunosuke-san?! Am I right?!"""
text29009;"""I snapped, but I couldn't feel any particular danger coming from him. I was, at least to a degree, confident he hadn't come to kill me."""
text29010;"""That's your point of view. You are entitled to it. But there are many others."""
text29011;"""However, Nikolai, you should calm down. That would be better for everyone."""
text29012;"""His impenetrable seriousness was more frightening than all of Irina's words combined."""
text29013;"""Is that a threat?"""
text29014;"""For now, it's a warning. I hope I'm not mistaken about you, and I won't need to deploy methods that are more appropriate for stupid scum."""
text29015;"""His arrogance stung — there was something of <note=note87>Japanese militarism</note> in him."""
text29016;"""And still, I was scared and simply couldn't hide it."""
text29017;"""Nikolai, I want to help you, no matter how crazy that may sound to you. I have helped you before, over many years. I've been doing things that go beyond the scope of my responsibilities."""
text29018;"""And even things that violated direct orders."""
text29019;"""He added in a quieter voice."""
text29020;"""I have done things you haven't a clue about…"""
text29021;"""Are you talking about my parents?"""
text29022;"""I smirked."""
text29023;"""Believe me, I have nothing to do with what happened to them."""
text29024;"""Of course you don't!"""
text29025;"""I realize that you have no reason to trust me, but <i>this</i> is a dangerous game you're playing, albeit against your will."""
text29026;"""You must have realized already that there are many players in this game. So, I will say once again: I have nothing to do with your parents' death."""
text29027;"""Himitsu's father seemed to speak genuinely, but I caught myself thinking that during the entire conversation his facial expression had barely changed."""
text29028;"""It doesn't matter what I think, right? Then why did you come here at all?"""
text29029;"""Finally, he knitted his brows and said quietly:"""
text29030;"""I need to know everything you know."""
text29031;"""If I knew something, I'd gladly tell you, you have my word! I'm so fucking fed up with your <i>game</i>!"""
text29032;"""I slapped my neck with my palm, showing how fed up I was exactly."""
text29033;"""So if I had a chance to do something that would make you all leave me be…"""
text29034;"""I believe you, Nikolai."""
text29035;"""He interrupted me and suddenly smiled."""
text29036;"""And that's… it?"""
text29037;"""Yes. Is there anything else you want to discuss?"""
text29038;"""What happens now?"""
text29039;"""To you? I don't know. However, you must realize that after everything that's happened, you better keep away from my daughter."""
text29040;"""How… but…"""
text29041;"""I mumbled impotently."""
text29042;"""Be well."""
text29043;"""Ryunosuke-san stood up and left."""
text29044;"""When the door closed behind him, I sank exhaustedly to the chair."""
text29045;"""Of course, arguing with him would've been pointless and risky, and, besides, what could I say?"""
text29046;"""It's not like Himitsu wanted to see me."""
text29047;"""But that was only for now — in the end, she'd definitely come! <w>Wouldn't she...?"""
text29048;"""And what did he mean by \""I don't know\""?!"""
text29049;"""That I didn't have to fear Japanese intelligence anymore?"""
text29050;"""Or that everything was over for me?"""
text29051;"""No… <w>If that were the case, he wouldn't have warned me about Himitsu."""
text29052;"""I was shattered and crushed, and, most importantly — humiliated."""
text29053;"""For the first time!"""
text29054;"""Irina could threaten me all she wanted, but she didn't have any aces up her sleeve."""
text29055;"""Ryunosuke-san had Himitsu."""
text29056;"""And he played his card brilliantly, breaking my will and bringing me to my knees in a couple of minutes."""
text29057;"""If I had anything to tell them, I would've done it immediately, without hesitation!"""
text29058;"""Ichinose? <w>It didn't seem like they were really interested in him."""
text29059;"""My conversations with Irina or Kagome? <w>They were, in the end, not very informative."""
text29060;"""And I didn't know anything except that…"""
text29061;"""But why? <w>Why was it so <i>easy</i>?"""
text29062;"""The answer to this question was becoming more and more obvious."""
text29063;"""I couldn't stay home alone now."""
text29064;"""If something happens, you know where to find me."""
text29065;"""And there I was, dialling that cherished number again."""
text29066;"""It was quite early, but maybe she was at home?"""
text29067;"""After a few beeps, somebody eventually responded."""
text29068;"""Hello."""
text29069;"""Hi, it's me…"""
text29070;"""Catherine didn't reply."""
text29071;"""You're already back from school…"""
text29072;"""And silence again."""
text29073;"""What was I trying to achieve by stating facts?"""
text29074;"""I summoned all my courage and said:"""
text29075;"""You said that I would know where to find you. I guess I have."""
text29076;"""In the park in an hour."""
text29077;"""Katya replied briefly and hung up."""
text29078;"""Everything seemed to have worked maybe too easily."""
text29079;"""Despite my efforts, I didn't manage to arrive before Catherine."""
text29080;"""She was already waiting for me there — her house was much closer to the park."""
text29081;"""Catch your breath first."""
text29082;"""She smiled condescendingly and pointed at a bench."""
text29083;"""We sat down."""
text29084;"""Not a day passed…"""
text29085;"""Sorry if I distracted you from something important."""
text29086;"""I always have time for you!"""
text29087;"""Besides, it's clear something's happened."""
text29088;"""When I called Catherine, I hadn't figured out what I was going to tell her. <w>It was just a whim, and a lack of other options."""
text29089;"""I looked at her with a plea in my eyes, as if hoping that she'd guess it all herself and I wouldn't have to lie, or worse, tell her everything in detail."""
text29090;"""Himitsu?"""
text29091;"""Yes… we… had a fight. Not that it's the first time, but this time it's serious."""
text29092;"""You talked to her after everything I've told you? Although, you already knew…"""
text29093;"""Yeah…"""
text29094;"""Unlike Himitsu, I hadn't promised not to lie to Catherine, and she didn't have to know what Ryunosuke-san had told me."""
text29095;"""My life doesn't change much…"""
text29096;"""That's for sure. But why am I here?"""
text29097;"""I just… Well…"""
text29098;"""I had even less desire to say that I'd just felt lonely and that Kyosuke wouldn't have made for good company here."""
text29099;"""Although even if I'd had a choice, would I have called someone else?"""
text29100;"""I just don't want to be alone."""
text29101;"""You get used to it. It's not quick and easy, but, eventually, you get used to it."""
text29102;"""She caught a yellowish leaf flying in the air and attentively, as if studying it, spun it in her fingers."""
text29103;"""I have a lot of experience in terms of loneliness."""
text29104;"""Katya, I…"""
text29105;"""You're unteachable!"""
text29106;"""What...?"""
text29107;"""How many times have I asked you not to call me Katya!?"""
text29108;"""But you never meant it."""
text29109;"""See, that's your problem: you always think everything in life is a game."""
text29110;"""I don't think anything like that!"""
text29111;"""And even if it's a game, it's not one you can win."""
text29112;"""Although I'm glad you called. Didn't think it would happen so soon."""
text29113;"""So, she didn't doubt I'd call at some point...?"""
text29114;"""And I'm glad you've finally realized what <i>she</i> is."""
text29115;"""I replied nothing and lowered my head in order to avoid looking her in the eye."""
text29116;"""No, I partially agreed with Catherine's opinion on Himitsu, but there was still nothing I could do."""
text29117;"""Even if she hadn't known about her father's real job, even if she hadn't wanted to betray me or hide anything — all of this had happened already!"""
text29118;"""And nothing could change the fact that she had been lying to me, even if not for long."""
text29119;"""I can understand why Himitsu treats you like she does, but you… what has she done to you?"""
text29120;"""Catherine grew embarrassed and immediately tensed up.<seq ca_serious>"""
text29121;"""Isn't what she's done to you enough? Even if we're not together anymore, it doesn't mean that…"""
text29122;"""She clicked her tongue and raised her voice even more:"""
text29123;"""It's a pity that you don't realize it yourself!"""
text29124;"""But I did…"""
text29125;"""I understood that Himitsu was dedicating herself wholeheartedly to me, yet I couldn't forgive her for a single stupid mistake. <w>And neither could I forget about the skeletons in her closet."""
text29126;"""If not hers then her father's!"""
text29127;"""The plates of the scales were swaying back and forth."""
text29128;"""And then there was Catherine, whose intentions I hadn't understood at all for a while now."""
text29129;"""Sometimes I felt ashamed for being so spineless."""
text29130;"""You have your circumstances…"""
text29131;"""You've said as much too."""
text29132;"""Maybe I have…"""
text29133;"""Catherine smiled sadly, torturing the poor leaf."""
text29134;"""Winter is coming… You like winter. Thank your surname!"""
text29135;"""You know I feel the same about all four seasons."""
text29136;"""What about Christmas, New Year's? What would you like to get as a gift from Santa Claus?"""
text29137;"""A one-way ticket away from here!"""
text29138;"""One ticket?"""
text29139;"""Catherine tilted her head, and her eyes flashed."""
text29140;"""Do you want to talk about this <i>now</i>?"""
text29141;"""What about the destination? Isn't that important?"""
text29142;"""I tried to smooth out the awkwardness."""
text29143;"""To the Moon."""
text29144;"""We were sitting there, talking about nothing — that was exactly what I needed."""
text29145;"""So you're going to be the first person on the Moon!"""
text29146;"""Hey!"""
text29147;"""Catherine gently nudged me in the side."""
text29148;"""Well everyone knows Stanley Kubrick faked the Apollo landing!"""
text29149;"""Are you asking for another Caribbean Crisis? This time the missiles will be at your coast!"""
text29150;"""Knowing the Japanese, I wouldn't be surprised!"""
text29151;"""This is all bad, isn't it?"""
text29152;"""Of course it is. I look at you and Himitsu, and I see no differences, borders, nations."""
text29153;"""Maybe that's the case in a perfect world, but I would prefer to <i>have no differences</i> somewhere far away from here."""
text29154;"""Have you ever read Heinlein?"""
text29155;"""No, why?"""
text29156;"""Nothing, I just think you'd like his books."""
text29157;"""Your whole world really is science fiction. Except there's no science in it!"""
text29158;"""Himitsu had told me almost the same once."""
text29159;"""I've heard that somewhere before."""
text29160;"""See!"""
text29161;"""What about you? You don't even have hobbies!"""
text29162;"""Not for lack of desire…"""
text29163;"""She replied, offended by my words."""
text29164;"""What do you mean?"""
text29165;"""When you need to move all the time… I never told you…"""
text29166;"""Even in the US we kept moving around the country every couple months."""
text29167;"""It's like I'm seven years old and can't be left alone! Or, at least, with my grandma!"""
text29168;"""I didn't know."""
text29169;"""Good that you didn't — there's nothing interesting about that!"""
text29170;"""Catherine stood up, smiled way too nicely, and gave me a hand."""
text29171;"""Let's go, I'm cold!"""
text29172;"""Where...?"""
text29173;"""I'd like to eat something, you?"""
text29174;"""Can do. A cafe?"""
text29175;"""Let's go to your place."""
text29176;"""But I have nothing to eat at home… Should we order something?"""
text29177;"""I replied after a short pause."""
text29178;"""Why all of a sudden?"""
text29179;"""I'll cook — we just need to drop by a store on the way."""
text29180;"""Alright, let's go…"""
text29181;"""Catherine spent a long time meticulously choosing groceries."""
text29182;"""I would sometimes go shopping with Himitsu and always thought of it as routine, but now I was in awe."""
text29183;"""Catherine and I had known each other for a while, but what had we been doing usually? <w>Yeah, that…"""
text29184;"""And other dumb stuff that couples in love always do."""
text29185;"""Even now, little changed: we were fighting and scolding each other — a rather trivial thing to do for two people who had feelings for each other."""
text29186;"""My relationships with Catherine and with Himitsu were as different from each other as a melodrama about school love and a family sitcom."""
text29187;"""Besides, mere infatuation isn't enough: a really strong bond is formed through everyday, mundane moments."""
text29188;"""And it seemed as normal to me to do this with Himitsu as felt new with Catherine."""
text29189;"""However, there was something else."""
text29190;"""At first, all this <i>daily stuff </i> with a person you love creates a misleading feeling of intimacy, and that's when you start to imagine that you are like a family now and will never leave each other."""
text29191;"""Hopefully, the other person is of the same opinion…"""
text29192;"""Then any <i>unexpected</i> issues will be unexpected for both of you."""
text29193;"""However, if that isn't the case, the first problem you run into will become a long-awaited excuse for them."""
text29194;"""Katya wanted to take some lettuce, while I had a preference for Chinese cabbage."""
text29195;"""Did it really matter?"""
text29196;"""In order to avoid any disputes, I relented immediately, but it made me think…"""
text29197;"""It was almost evening when we reached home."""
text29198;"""I don't mean to imply anything, but isn't this a bit much...?"""
text29199;"""I demonstratively raised the bags in my hands that were indeed quite heavy."""
text29200;"""Luckily, Catherine flatly refused to take my money and paid for everything — I wasn't even sure if I had enough for all that…"""
text29201;"""Are you unhappy about something?"""
text29202;"""It just feels like you're going to cook for a whole regiment."""
text29203;"""Maybe I am."""
text29204;"""She smiled mysteriously and entered the yard."""
text29205;"""While Catherine was cooking, I sat down in front of the TV and started to think."""
text29206;"""I could hardly expect Himitsu to visit, but if she did, it would be quite difficult to explain all <i>this</i> to her."""
text29207;"""This sense of intimacy with Katya was growing stronger — as if that was exactly what she was trying to accomplish!"""
text29208;"""Look, thank you, really…"""
text29209;"""Catherine stopped cooking and looked at me, confused."""
text29210;"""I really need some support right now…"""
text29211;"""\""And someone close around\"", — I wanted to add but held myself back."""
text29212;"""Happy to help."""
text29213;"""No, I'm serious!"""
text29214;"""Well, so am I."""
text29215;"""The dinner was surprisingly delicious."""
text29216;"""Hamburgers and french fries. <w>Homemade."""
text29217;"""You know, I don't eat this stuff often. Fast food is one thing, but it can't compare to this!"""
text29218;"""I guess it'll add at least some variety to your menu then."""
text29219;"""She was clearly hinting at Himitsu's cooking, but I didn't reply, busy consuming the burger."""
text29220;"""To be frank, I was quite sceptical when you said you could cook."""
text29221;"""What about yesterday's breakfast?"""
text29222;"""Well, sometimes even pigs fly."""
text29223;"""Catherine frowned."""
text29224;"""That's not nice, you know."""
text29225;"""And I thought that it sounded quite like her and in the spirit of our recent conversations."""
text29226;"""Sorry…"""
text29227;"""Luckily for you, you won't have to eat it all the time. I think Himitsu will soon…"""
text29228;"""She didn't finish the phrase and suddenly quickly looked at the clock."""
text29229;"""Late for something?"""
text29230;"""I need to call my mom."""
text29231;"""The question \""Why?\"" was on the tip of my tongue, but I restrained myself."""
text29232;"""Go ahead. You know where the phone is."""
text29233;"""Catherine talked quietly, and I wasn't really trying to listen."""
text29234;"""At the moment I was more concerned with how to act with her going forward."""
text29235;"""Sorry that took so long."""
text29236;"""It was maybe a couple minutes."""
text29237;"""No worries."""
text29238;"""She looked a bit anxious."""
text29239;"""Is everything alright?"""
text29240;"""Stupid question — why do people always ask it? And most importantly, what answer do you expect to hear?"""
text29241;"""I know what you mean, gets to me too. Just a habit."""
text29242;"""I smiled apologetically."""
text29243;"""Let me wash the dishes."""
text29244;"""She started to hectically collect the dishes from the table."""
text29245;"""Well… okay."""
text29246;"""I returned to the TV, and Catherine started to wash dishes, doing it very slowly, deliberately slowly."""
text29247;"""What's on TV?"""
text29248;"""Eventually, she finished and sat next to me. <w>Dangerously close…"""
text29249;"""Just some garbage…"""
text29250;"""But Katya was a rather straightforward girl and usually preferred to talk directly rather than trouble herself with hints."""
text29251;"""I, on the other hand, knew that in such a situation I was fully at her mercy."""
text29252;"""If she moved any closer…"""
text29253;"""I'll be right back…"""
text29254;"""I stood up and walked out of the kitchen without looking back."""
text29255;"""If not for Himitsu… <w>How would I be acting right now if we hadn't fought?"""
text29256;"""And what would I have done a week or two ago?"""
text29257;"""Apparently, I wouldn't have had any qualms of conscience – and that was exactly what was stopping me at this moment!"""
text29258;"""What do we really fear the most — to be caught with a lover in bed? Or that our own sense of guilt will always be there, making itself known when we look into the eyes of the person we love?"""
text29259;"""The funniest thing was that I felt guilty toward Himitsu even though we formally weren't in any kind of relationship."""
text29260;"""And now she wasn't talking to me at all!"""
text29261;"""My dignity rebelled at last."""
text29262;"""I stopped by to the toilet for show then immediately returned to the TV."""
text29263;"""There was some sort of animal show on the screen."""
text29264;"""I don't understand anything, not a word!"""
text29265;"""Katya said merrily, staring at the screen."""
text29266;"""What do you mean?"""
text29267;"""Well, they use special terms, names..."""
text29268;"""Well… yeah… I guess you don't know them in English either?"""
text29269;"""A little bird with a giant red cap was sitting on a bench, looking important."""
text29270;"""Maybe."""
text29271;"""It's quite late already…"""
text29272;"""For what?"""
text29273;"""Shouldn't you go home?"""
text29274;"""No."""
text29275;"""Catherine turned to me and smiled meaningfully."""
text29276;"""Are you kicking me out?"""
text29277;"""It's just that your hints…"""
text29278;"""I'm not trying to hint at anything. You can make me a bed in this room. I've already warned my mom."""
text29279;"""So that's why she was calling her mother!"""
text29280;"""Why did it take me until now to notice that she was in her school uniform...?"""
text29281;"""Katya, what is this all about?"""
text29282;"""Last time it didn't end well…"""
text29283;"""I'm just tired and feel too lazy to go home."""
text29284;"""No more than that! It's just you seeing hidden meanings in everything!"""
text29285;"""I looked at the clock — it wasn't that late!"""
text29286;"""If this is another game or joke of yours…"""
text29287;"""If I wanted something, I would've told you!"""
text29288;"""I guess she was right about that."""
text29289;"""Well, it's your call."""
text29290;"""…"""
text29291;"""I was lying in my bed and couldn't close my eyes."""
text29292;"""Mostly because of the fact that Catherine was sleeping in the other room… <w>Or was she?!"""
text29293;"""She could easily come in the middle of the night and lie next to me."""
text29294;"""She'd get cold… <w>or scared… <w>or lonely…"""
text29295;"""She would find a reason, come up with an excuse, and in the morning I would end up the one to blame anyway."""
text29296;"""But even more than that, I was terrified by my own desires!"""
text29297;"""I would've never called myself a masochist, but in our relationship, she was definitely the sadist!"""
text29298;"""The silence of the night felt oppressive."""
text29299;"""I walked through the house, trying to avoid the kitchen, and closed all the doors from inside."""
text29300;"""God spare me if Himitsu decided to come in the morning…"""
text29301;"""Having locked and deadbolted all the doors, I finally managed to fall asleep."""

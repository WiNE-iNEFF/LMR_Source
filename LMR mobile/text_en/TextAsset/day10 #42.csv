text34132;"""In this case however, it was a diseased retrospective on recent events."""
text34133;"""I was chasing Catherine, while she was running away yet constantly turning around, smiling, waving at me and shouting something."""
text34134;"""Her words were carried away by the wind, and only her eyes shone and lips moved in silent labor."""
text34135;"""Niko-kun!"""
text34136;"""I started to hear behind me."""
text34137;"""Niko-kun!"""
text34138;"""The voice was becoming ever clearer."""
text34139;"""Himitsu was chasing me."""
text34140;"""She didn't look angry, but rather sad and weary."""
text34141;"""Where was I running to? <w>After or from who?"""
text34142;"""In a dream, you move easily, effortlessly, as if floating, immediately gaining unprecedented speed without getting strained or tired."""
text34143;"""As if standing on an escalator as it rushes ahead."""

text34147;"""This happens sometimes: you don't need to glance at the clock or look outside — your own body gives a signal that it has yet to fully recover."""
text34148;"""The heavy head, the puffy eyes, the dry horrors — I knew these symptoms all too well."""
text34149;"""Except I hadn't been drinking yesterday!"""
text34150;"""I got the feeling that sleeping the rest of the time I had left wasn't the best idea."""
text34151;"""The Catherine from the dream seemed to have stopped, and I finally managed to hear what she was shouting."""
text34152;"""\""We shouldn't have met at all!\"""""
text34153;"""… have met at all!"""
text34154;"""… have met …"""
text34155;"""I rolled to the other side."""
text34156;"""The KGB, the Japanese, the Project, Kobayashi Corporation, even my parents' death — if all that hadn't happened, Catherine would've still remained in my life."""
text34157;"""Moreover, she would've remained even had she not returned to Japan!"""

text34163;"""A cup of hot tea woke me up."""
text34164;"""I seemed to recall that this pack hadn't been here before."""
text34165;"""Could Himitsu have brought it?"""
text34166;"""Himitsu…"""
text34167;"""She was about to come to wake me up."""
text34168;"""How surprised she'd be to see…"""
text34169;"""Except I didn't want her to see me at all."""
text34170;"""Not today, not right now."""
text34171;"""Perhaps yesterday had gone a bit better than I could've expected."""
text34172;"""Perhaps I had reason to hope that my life would get better, at least in some respects."""

text34174;"""She can't see me like this."""
text34175;"""I was absolutely positive she would realize everything right away."""
text34176;"""I felt naked, with my feelings exposed, defenceless before the outside world."""
text34177;"""And so I ran…"""
text34178;"""I left the house and simply walked wherever my feet would take me."""
text34179;"""My pace wasn't particularly fast but not slow either — I watched the road and the traffic lights, even avoided running into people."""
text34180;"""But it was all done on autopilot — my mind was elsewhere."""
text34181;"""Maybe in the dream where I was chasing Catherine."""
text34182;"""Chasing with full understanding that I would never catch her."""
text34183;"""Life can be a strange thing…"""
text34184;"""Katya lived just a couple kilometres away from here — I could just go and ring her doorbell."""
text34185;"""Even if it was still too early and she was asleep!"""
text34186;"""I could scale the fire escape and climb into her window!"""
text34187;"""And then I could tell her everything I wanted to say."""

text34197;"""…"""
text34198;"""Soon I found myself in the park."""
text34199;"""It had been a while since last came here!"""
text34200;"""I used to go here with Katya."""
text34201;"""She used to say this was the only place in the city where we could be alone."""
text34202;"""Or maybe she didn't and I just assumed that's what she thought."""
text34203;"""Catherine never liked to publicly show her feelings, and sometimes it even seemed like she was embarrassed that someone would see us together."""
text34204;"""The park itself was more or less a classical Japanese garden."""
text34205;"""I always thought that in a way nature was the same everywhere."""
text34206;"""Sure, Earth had different climates, some trees would grow on one continent but completely refuse to take root on another."""
text34207;"""But in general, it was the same vegetation, the same soil, the same murmuring streams."""
text34208;"""Maybe that was because we rarely perceive nature as something discrete."""
text34209;"""We may often think about the age of a particular tree, but no one counts the blades of grass in a meadow or the grains of sand at a beach."""
text34210;"""Neither is a plucked flower perceived by us as the end of a separate biological entity. It's just a <i>process</i> — it will wither, rot, and turn into something new."""
text34211;"""I walked into our favorite gazebo and sat down on a bench."""

text34213;"""Here — in a forest, you could say — the arrival of autumn wasn't as apparent, even though the temperature was a couple of degrees lower than in the city."""
text34214;"""I probably still wasn't used to summer-like warmth in the middle of September."""
text34215;"""What was the weather <i>then</i>, I wondered."""
text34216;"""It had been two years…"""
text34217;"""Two years, is that a lot for plants? <w>What about century-old oaks? <w>What about me?"""
text34218;"""I sank into my memories."""
text34219;"""My first summer in high school had ended."""
text34220;"""To be honest, I no longer remember what I felt, thought, strived for at the time."""
text34221;"""Only that I was simpler, more naïve."""
text34222;"""It was a normal school day."""
text34223;"""Fundamentally, our high school differed from its middle counterpart only in name and was located on the same grounds."""
text34224;"""I knew many of the students — <note=note123>we had been in the same class before</note>."""
text34225;"""Besides, my good, chubby friend Kyosuke was sitting next to me!"""
text34226;"""Don't you think it's weird we've ended up in the same class however many times now?"""
text34227;"""Are you implying that it's not a coincidence?"""
text34228;"""He made one of those grins that practically screamed \""come on, ask me what I mean!\"""""
text34229;"""I'm just stating a fact."""
text34230;"""Because if I thought you arranged it somehow, I'd start to feel weird. Scared, even!"""
text34231;"""Why me exactly?"""
text34232;"""Who else could it be?"""
text34233;"""He huffily mumbled something in response."""
text34234;"""I think we've got a nice class here!"""
text34235;"""I looked around the classroom, but my eyes didn't linger on anyone in particular."""
text34236;"""Probably because I didn't have any particular ties to any of them."""
text34237;"""What do you think about…"""
text34238;"""He moved closer to me and whispered:"""
text34239;"""...the girls?"""
text34240;"""Well, I don't really know."""
text34241;"""I'd lie if I said I didn't think about it — any normal guy my age does."""
text34242;"""But thoughts were where it ended. It was hard for me to even imagine myself next to someone other than Himitsu."""
text34243;"""Even though I didn't think about her <i>that</i> way either."""
text34244;"""If you were to rank them, who'd get first place?"""
text34245;"""Ratings are your thing, piss off!"""
text34246;"""I cracked back in good nature."""
text34247;"""You're obviously hiding something!"""
text34248;"""Why would I be <i>hiding something</i>?"""
text34249;"""Fine, I'll start then. What do you think about…"""
text34250;"""He raised his finger and started to run it around the classroom, as if choosing a toy in a shop's window."""
text34251;"""Winters-san, let's say!"""
text34252;"""Catherine was sitting behind the front desk, her back turned to us."""
text34253;"""Her long hair lay so smoothly that it resembled a frozen waterfall."""
text34254;"""Although coldness was also inherent to her character. <w>At least that's how it seemed to me."""
text34255;"""I don't really know."""
text34256;"""I absolutely did know!"""
text34257;"""If I were to answer Kyosuke's question seriously — which I never would! — Catherine Winters would be at the top of my list."""
text34258;"""Why? You're both foreigners."""
text34259;"""Don't you think that's a bit сhauvinistic?"""
text34260;"""What?"""
text34261;"""I said the last word in English because I read it in some sci-fi novel and simply didn't know how to say it in Japanese."""
text34262;"""Apparently, the vocabulary of the heroes in Kyosuke's manga was a bit poorer."""
text34263;"""I'm calling you a dickweed."""
text34264;"""You do realize your reaction is a little suspicious?"""
text34265;"""Fine, what do you want to hear?"""
text34266;"""Rate her out of ten!"""
text34267;"""Let's say… seven?"""
text34268;"""So low?"""
text34269;"""He flung his arms up disappointedly."""
text34270;"""What, should I give a ten to each and every one of them? Having a top score wouldn't mean shit then! We're not in first grade where everyone gets A's in art class!"""
text34271;"""I didn't get any A's…"""
text34272;"""You're a different story, I'm talking about normal people!"""
text34273;"""Oh, is that so? Should I pass your score over to Ms Winters then?"""
text34274;"""He stood up from the chair theatrically slowly."""
text34275;"""What are you doing?! Calm down and sit!"""
text34276;"""Of course, I didn't believe that Kyosuke really intended to do that."""
text34277;"""First and foremost, I didn't believe he had the courage."""
text34278;"""Scared, are you?"""
text34279;"""I'm really not — just, why?"""
text34280;"""Let's call it putting your personal life in order! Otherwise you'll be alone forever…"""
text34281;"""Look who's talking! Also, did you think to ask for her opinion first?"""
text34282;"""Well, you <i>are</i> quite the guy, the cock of the walk!"""
text34283;"""He grinned and finally sat back down."""
text34284;"""When you're the one saying that… it just sounds wrong!"""
text34285;"""We laughed together."""
text34286;"""…"""
text34287;"""The lessons ended, and I was on my way home with Himitsu."""
text34288;"""I couldn't get Kyosuke's classmate ranking out of my head. <w>Or at least the rank of one classmate — Catherine Winters."""
text34289;"""I had paid attention to her before."""
text34290;"""Maybe it actually was because she wasn't Japanese, but more likely because she was beautiful, elegant, clever, and possessed a kind of mysterious charm."""
text34291;"""At the time I didn't realize that she was simply more mature and feminine than the other girls."""
text34292;"""And in some sense, Kyosuke was right. I was hiding — even if just from myself — that I liked Catherine."""
text34293;"""Which is quite easy to do if you don't think about a girl in the context of a relationship."""
text34294;"""We talk about the beauty of actresses on TV screens, but few people actually fall in love with them."""
text34295;"""It's another matter when the actress is your classmate…"""
text34296;"""That makes her way more human, in a sense, and also available — not just a 2D picture, but a real girl you can at the very least talk to."""
text34297;"""Listen, do you like anyone in your class?"""
text34298;"""I asked Himitsu, continuing the flow of my thoughts aloud."""
text34299;"""But to her, this question was completely unexpected."""
text34300;"""L-like? What do you mean?"""
text34301;"""Well, any of the guys."""
text34302;"""Why do you ask, Niko-kun?"""
text34303;"""Just talked with Kyosuke over break. New class, new school, you know…"""
text34304;"""So? Do <i>you</i> like someone?"""
text34305;"""At the time I didn't even think about Himitsu's feelings, didn't think the conversation might be unpleasant for her. <w>I was just talking about a normal school day with a friend."""
text34306;"""I don't really know…"""
text34307;"""I grinned stupidly, scratched the back of my head, and turned away to hide my embarrassment."""
text34308;"""Niko-kun!"""
text34309;"""Himitsu said angrily."""
text34310;"""You wouldn't have brought this up for no reason!"""
text34311;"""Alright, my bad! There may be a certain American…"""
text34312;"""American, huh...?"""
text34313;"""Himitsu drawled."""
text34314;"""Is she pretty?"""
text34315;"""What do you think?"""
text34316;"""Well, she's certainly not going to like you!"""
text34317;"""Why is that?!"""
text34318;"""I asked with indignation."""
text34319;"""Because you're lazy, rude, and insensitive! Also sloppy and scruffy! Imagine if she saw what goes on in your room!"""
text34320;"""Himitsu said all this in good nature, but her words still got to me."""
text34321;"""Why, thank you for the compliments!"""
text34322;"""But that's the truth! You can't be offended by the truth!"""
text34323;"""Truth… Yeah, right…"""
text34324;"""I grumbled."""
text34325;"""In all seriousness though."""
text34326;"""Himitsu said a little later, her voice now completely different."""
text34327;"""What do you think about that girl?"""
text34328;"""I don't think anything yet."""
text34329;"""So you're just gonna watch from a distance and do nothing?"""
text34330;"""I don't know."""
text34331;"""That's not right, I think. If you like someone, you should tell them!"""
text34332;"""Would you?"""
text34333;"""Me?! We're talking about you right now!"""
text34334;"""Maybe I will…"""
text34335;"""But time passed, and it became obvious that I had to do something."""
text34336;"""I thought of Catherine more and more often, and the thoughts were starting to become frankly obtrusive."""
text34337;"""But at first, even approaching her seemed like an impossible task to me — so inaccessible she appeared."""
text34338;"""Besides, Catherine barely talked to our other classmates either."""
text34339;"""At first, I thought it was just due to her personality, but sometimes things would get simply ridiculous."""
text34340;"""One time, working in a pair, she went an entire lesson without saying a word."""
text34341;"""Proudly, with her head held high and a sense of dignity to her — just like a real lady."""
text34342;"""But still silently — and she ended up with an F."""
text34343;"""It would be one thing if that was all there was to it, but it was an English lesson!"""
text34344;"""It was hard to doubt Catherine's knowledge of it, but a school is a social institution where both the result and the method matter."""
text34345;"""You could solve math problems with a calculator, but you wouldn't get an A for it."""
text34346;"""In the end, Katya turned up her nose and left the class."""
text34347;"""I felt like it was my chance and, complaining about terrible a stomach ache to the teacher, went after her."""
text34348;"""Giving an F to a native is messed up! That's exactly why I don't take Russian."""
text34349;"""I caught up to her on the staircase and awkwardly tried to start a conversation."""
text34350;"""Catherine just gave me a look of distrust and said:"""
text34351;"""Yeah."""
text34352;"""Her Japanese grades weren't exactly amazing either, to say the least."""
text34353;"""And thus, finally, I found Catherine Winters' weak spot."""
text34354;"""…"""
text34355;"""At lunch, I approached her, smiled, and started to speak in Japanese as legibly as I could manage."""
text34356;"""Hi. Sorry, for saying this out of the blue, but I noticed you were having a hard time with Japanese. Mind if I help? My name's Nikolai, by the way."""
text34357;"""She raised her surprised eyes at me and answered coldly:"""
text34358;"""Thank you, but I'm fine."""
text34359;"""I mean, I understand that it's really stressful to end up in a foreign country, and a new school too… I've just been living in Japan for a while now..."""
text34360;"""I'm fine."""
text34361;"""She interrupted me in the same tone."""
text34362;"""You know, the language matters the most! The faster you learn it, the faster you'll adapt…"""
text34363;"""Catherine's look robbed me of all resolve to continue."""
text34364;"""Or not…"""
text34365;"""…"""
text34366;"""From the first moment of our acquaintance, Ms Winters made it clear that she only saw me as yet another annoying classmate."""
text34367;"""She wasn't any good at making friends, and I wondered more and more often if her lack of Japanese skills really was the reason for it."""
text34368;"""However, besides disappointment, I was also overflowing with enthusiasm, a desire to get my way at all costs."""
text34369;"""One day in the canteen, I unceremoniously sat across from Catherine without an invitation."""
text34370;"""Bon appetit!"""
text34371;"""She didn't respond and even seemed to pretend I wasn't there."""
text34372;"""I just wanted to say I know we got off on the wrong foot. My bad — I shouldn't have imposed myself!"""
text34373;"""It's not your fault."""
text34374;"""Catherine immediately switched to English."""
text34375;"""I just don't need help with Japanese. My knowledge is quite sufficient to survive the next three years here."""
text34376;"""Do you really hate it here that much?"""
text34377;"""I responded in English as well, in anticipation of her reaction."""
text34378;"""Catherine didn't even bat an eye."""
text34379;"""How do I put it…"""
text34380;"""It seemed like I had been reading too much of Kyosuke's manga — why did I even think she thought that I didn't know English?"""
text34381;"""In any case, now she was much friendlier than the first time. <w>At least by her standards."""
text34382;"""You know, at first I was really afraid of this new country. Everything was so… big!"""
text34383;"""Although I had it easier, of course, being a child and all."""
text34384;"""Continuing to demonstrate her utter lack of interest, Catherine finally joined the conversation:"""
text34385;"""How old were you?"""
text34386;"""Seven, can you imagine?!"""
text34387;"""I said enthusiastically."""
text34388;"""I can. I was seven once too."""
text34389;"""So what brought you here...? To Japan I mean, not the canteen!"""
text34390;"""My mom is a diplomat."""
text34391;"""Oh, really? My parents are engineers. They work for Kobayashi Corporation, heard of it?"""
text34392;"""I have."""
text34393;"""Catherine kept poking her fork into something that probably used to be a beef roast."""
text34394;"""So you're from the Soviet Union then?"""
text34395;"""Yes ma'am! Nikolai Anokhin, at your service!"""
text34396;"""Our countries don't have the best relationship. Why do you think ours will be any better?"""
text34397;"""She smiled, if barely."""
text34398;"""Well, politics aren't my strong suit, but I don't think the common people should suffer because of the decisions of a bunch of idiots at power."""
text34399;"""I immediately realized it was correct to say \""in power\"", but Catherine didn't give me a chance to correct myself."""
text34400;"""That is a very shallow understanding of politics, Nikolai."""
text34401;"""I did say it's not my strong suit…"""
text34402;"""So you advocate for world peace and friendship among all peoples?"""
text34403;"""That'd be better, wouldn't it?"""
text34404;"""I guess…"""
text34405;"""What about you then?"""
text34406;"""And why are we even talking about politics?"""
text34407;"""I laughed."""
text34408;"""You started it."""
text34409;"""No I didn't! You said that our countries don't have the best relationship!"""
text34410;"""Well, let's say so. Was nice talking to you."""
text34411;"""Catherine stood up, took her tray, and left."""
text34412;"""Not that I was going to stop her — this round had clearly been lost."""
text34413;"""…"""
text34414;"""Several more days passed, and I was waiting for Catherine at the school gates to \""go home together\""."""
text34415;"""Yeah, right, next I'd be offering to carry her backpack!"""
text34416;"""I probably still hadn't realized at the time, but my attempts to get close to her were transforming into a sort of competition between the two of us."""
text34417;"""Oh, hey! Going home? Me too."""
text34418;"""What a coincidence!"""
text34419;"""The only result of my actions so far was the fact that she started to show more emotions."""
text34420;"""Most of which more or less fit under the definition of the word \""sarcasm\""."""
text34421;"""Are you taking the subway?"""
text34422;"""Yes. And for some reason, I feel like so are you."""
text34423;"""For your information, I could go on foot, but since we've got ourselves this \""coincidence\""…"""
text34424;"""I don't mind at all, don't get me wrong."""
text34425;"""I would never, God forbid!"""
text34426;"""For a while we walked in silence — I pretended to harbour a grudge against Catherine, and she wasn't one to start a conversation."""
text34427;"""Or so it seemed to me…"""
text34428;"""Your English is pretty good."""
text34429;"""I read a lot."""
text34430;"""What do you read?"""
text34431;"""Science fiction, mostly. Sheckley, Clark, Simak, Heinlein."""
text34432;"""I don't like science fiction."""
text34433;"""Well, girls rarely do."""
text34434;"""Do you know many?"""
text34435;"""A couple."""
text34436;"""Himitsu, for one."""
text34437;"""I see."""
text34438;"""From that moment on, my presence no longer interested her."""
text34439;"""What books do you like?"""
text34440;"""Books? I can't really say. All kinds."""
text34441;"""My patience ran out."""
text34442;"""Listen, maybe you should stop acting like this?"""
text34443;"""How am I acting, exactly?"""
text34444;"""Catherine even stopped."""
text34445;"""You know full well that I like you. Then why all this? If you said \""no\"" right away, we wouldn't need to put on this act!"""
text34446;"""You like me?"""
text34447;"""That's when I grew embarrassed."""
text34448;"""Isn't that obvious?"""
text34449;"""Not to a girl. Didn't you say you have a lot of experience with them?"""
text34450;"""I said nothing like that! And anyway…"""
text34451;"""So you want to date me?"""
text34452;"""Well… yeah… That's a given!"""
text34453;"""Alright."""
text34454;"""Alright what?"""
text34455;"""I asked, dumbfounded."""
text34456;"""Let's date."""
text34457;"""Just like that?"""
text34458;"""You did say that I could've said \""no\"" right away… I choose to say \""yes\""!"""
text34459;"""Catherine gifted me with a genuine smile."""
text34460;"""Well, okay then…"""
text34461;"""I almost asked, \""what should we do now?\""."""
text34462;"""By the way, we're here."""
text34463;"""And indeed, the station showed up from behind the corner."""
text34464;"""You must have a lot to think about. And since you don't live far from here…"""
text34465;"""…"""
text34466;"""See you tomorrow then… boyfriend!"""
text34467;"""Catherine flashed an even cuter smile and left me standing in a complete stupor."""
text34468;"""Today I know that this kind of behavior was at least somewhat normal for her, but at the time I was so shocked that I didn't even feel any particular joy."""
text34469;"""Maybe I'd feel something similar if a hundred kilogram piece of concrete fell on the ground a meter away from me."""
text34470;"""It's nice that it didn't fall on my head, but…"""
text34471;"""The following days were each one better than the other."""
text34472;"""I grew closer with Catherine, and even though I didn't quite understand why she was like that, she became less arrogant."""
text34473;"""…"""
text34474;"""One day we were sitting in a park, embracing each other."""
text34475;"""America doesn't have parks like this one."""
text34476;"""Really? Seems like a pretty normal park to me."""
text34477;"""No, not normal at all. It's beautiful. Quiet, peaceful."""
text34478;"""Well, at least there's something in Japan that you like."""
text34479;"""Catherine's laugh was barely audible."""
text34480;"""By the way, do you know that in Russia you'd be called Katya?"""
text34481;"""Katya? Sounds weird."""
text34482;"""I think it's really cute! I'll be calling you that from now on."""
text34483;"""No way!"""
text34484;"""You don't like it?"""
text34485;"""You'd be called Nick in America!"""
text34486;"""You already call me Nick."""
text34487;"""She didn't respond, only sank deeper into my shoulder."""
text34488;"""We'll leave this place, right? Later, when we finish school."""
text34489;"""For America?"""
text34490;"""I couldn't say the prospect made me too happy."""
text34491;"""It seemed that my psyche wouldn't withstand another big relocation."""
text34492;"""For America or somewhere else."""
text34493;"""For the USSR?"""
text34494;"""I don't know."""
text34495;"""We'd need to get married first."""
text34496;"""Why's that?"""
text34497;"""They won't give me a visa otherwise!"""
text34498;"""Mom works at the embassy, we can come up with something!"""
text34499;"""Do you think she'd be happy that instead of going to college, her daughter…"""
text34500;"""Who said \""instead\""?!"""
text34501;"""Katya asked with indignation."""
text34502;"""Well, we'd need to live on something…"""
text34503;"""You'll go to work then, you don't want to study anymore either way."""
text34504;"""Sir, yes sir!"""
text34505;"""She laughed again."""
text34506;"""Do you really want to do all of that… with me?"""
text34507;"""The question surprised me, and I looked at her, but Catherine lowered her head."""
text34508;"""Of course! Wouldn't be here otherwise."""
text34509;"""Here — in this park? Or in Japan?"""
text34510;"""On this earth! Kyosuke invites me to <note=note124>the Yamato</note> crew all the time!"""
text34511;"""You have weird friends. And you're also weird!"""
text34512;"""My friends are totally normal! By the way, Himitsu's wanted to meet you for a while now."""
text34513;"""Your childhood friend? The half-Russian one?"""
text34514;"""Yeah, I've told you about her."""
text34515;"""You must have way more in common with her."""
text34516;"""Even if I thought about it, I couldn't say what interested I shared with Himitsu."""
text34517;"""What are you hinting at?"""
text34518;"""Nothing at all."""
text34519;"""She abruptly stood up from the bench and stretched her hand out to me."""
text34520;"""There's a special offer at the bar today: buy two burgers for the price of three and get the third one for free!"""
text34521;"""You're pulling my leg!"""
text34522;"""I grabbed her hand and pulled her to me."""
text34523;"""…"""
text34524;"""But Catherine meeting Himitsu was inevitable, and honestly, it was surprising that it didn't happen earlier."""
text34525;"""…"""
text34526;"""Yet another school day was coming to its end, and I was about to go home together with Cathrine."""
text34527;"""To my place, this time."""
text34528;"""We'd been dating for several weeks at that point, and the initial, strongest burst of passion was starting to wear off."""
text34529;"""Naturally, that didn't stop us from spending all our free time together."""
text34530;"""But that day, Himitsu met us at the gates of the school."""
text34531;"""Niko-kun… Hello!"""
text34532;"""She bowed way too low, and I hurried to introduce Catherine to her:"""
text34533;"""So uh, this is Himitsu. Himitsu, this is Catherine."""
text34534;"""Catherine-san."""
text34535;"""She was about to bow again but decided against it under my stern glare."""
text34536;"""Come on, why the formalities?"""
text34537;"""Katty-chan?"""
text34538;"""Himitsu asked, unsure."""
text34539;"""Katya only smiled back in embarrassment."""
text34540;"""Niko-kun, you never told me she was so tall!"""
text34541;"""Himitsu whispered to me."""
text34542;"""Never crossed my mind, to be honest…"""
text34543;"""Where do you study?"""
text34544;"""In middle school! Here, it's on the same grounds, I studied there too!"""
text34545;"""See, she used to get sick a lot and went to school a year later than me."""
text34546;"""Interesting."""
text34547;"""Catherine frowned slightly."""
text34548;"""Yeah, she always wanted to be in the same class as me but it never worked out."""
text34549;"""I think Himitsu can speak for herself."""
text34550;"""Katya suddenly interrupted me."""
text34551;"""Himitsu meanwhile was just standing nearby, picking at the ground with the tip of her shoe."""
text34552;"""She looked even smaller now, when compared to Catherine."""
text34553;"""Oh, yeah, sorry."""
text34554;"""The awkwardness soured the meeting of the two most important girls in my life."""
text34555;"""How about we celebrate your acquaintance then!"""
text34556;"""Niko-kun…"""
text34557;"""Himitsu said, still in a whisper but now with reproach."""
text34558;"""Why, that's actually a good idea! Don't you like it?"""
text34559;"""Catherine asked her."""
text34560;"""Only if there won't be any alcohol…"""
text34561;"""Alcohol? Does he usually...?"""
text34562;"""Not at all!"""
text34563;"""I waved my hands in denial."""
text34564;"""Received and understood. Thank you for the information."""
text34565;"""I didn't…"""
text34566;"""How much more am I going to learn about you, boyfriend?"""
text34567;"""She asked in English."""
text34568;"""Himitsu wasn't that good at the language, and this time Catherine was actually trying to hide the meaning of her words from others."""
text34569;"""Okay, it happened once or twice, she's just worried about me!"""
text34570;"""Worried, huh?"""
text34571;"""Katya immediately shifted her gaze to Himitsu."""
text34572;"""In any case, nice to meet you!"""
text34573;"""Me too."""
text34574;"""…"""
text34575;"""While the three of us were walking home, I was scolding Himitsu:"""
text34576;"""Why start with that again? Why say all that?! Who asked you?!"""
text34577;"""But I didn't even say anything…"""
text34578;"""Himitsu was about to burst into tears."""
text34579;"""I should add that she used to be even more awkward around people."""
text34580;"""You have to think before you speak! You made me out to be an alcoholic or something…"""
text34581;"""Anyway."""
text34582;"""I relented."""
text34583;"""Just don't do that anymore."""
text34584;"""That entire time, Catherine was watching us carefully, without a word."""
text34585;"""I was speaking quietly and wasn't sure she'd heard what the conversation was about exactly."""
text34586;"""You're quite close."""
text34587;"""Naturally, we've known each other for so many years! She's like a stupid little sister to me."""
text34588;"""Little sister, huh? Convenient."""
text34589;"""Want me to be the older one then? You can call me <note=note125>onee-san</note>! A threesome with two sisters at once, now that'd be something, wouldn't it? Lucky man."""
text34590;"""She finished off her snide remark with a juicy slap on my ass."""
text34591;"""Good thing Himitsu didn't notice anything, at least."""
text34592;"""Truth be told, I liked Catherine's peculiar sense of humor, but sometimes it crossed all possible lines, and not only by Japanese standards!"""
text34593;"""…"""
text34594;"""When we reached home, Himitsu made that stupid bow again and bid us farewell:"""
text34595;"""I think I'll go, I don't want to be a bother."""
text34596;"""Come on, you're not bothering us at all! Right, Nick?"""
text34597;"""Yeah, of course…"""
text34598;"""I thought I looked like an idiot."""
text34599;"""Even though for a moment, I enjoyed Katya's idea with the two sisters."""
text34600;"""But if you have something to do…"""
text34601;"""It has been a pleasure to meet you."""
text34602;"""She addressed Catherine."""
text34603;"""You've got an interesting friend."""
text34604;"""Not everyone could put up with someone like you for so many years!"""
text34605;"""Indeed, Catherine was right, even if she was yet to know to what extent."""
text34606;"""I suddenly returned to reality and looked around — the park was still just as quiet and autumn-appropriately chilly."""
text34607;"""The clock and my stomache together reminded me that it was high time for lunch."""
text34608;"""I was walking through the city, feeling detached from reality."""
text34609;"""Like Alice — stuck in a wonderland of memories, which by comparison made all the danger looming over me seem much less important."""
text34610;"""As if the best had already passed, and nothing good awaited me in the future."""
text34611;"""So what sense was there in worrying?"""
text34612;"""…"""
text34613;"""Hey there, Kolya, come on in! Long time no see!"""
text34614;"""Today the Bartender seemed to be the embodiment of hospitability."""
text34615;"""I'm just here for lunch."""
text34616;"""But a moment!"""
text34617;"""He was as eager to talk as always, but there were more visitors than usual, and he had to get back to work after bringing me my order."""
text34618;"""I was eating the ramen with gusto, and noted once again that all in all it was no worse than in a real Japanese ramen shop."""
text34619;"""Despite all the Bartender's peculiarties, you couldn't deny that he knew his trade!"""
text34620;"""He just had to remove that irritating bell over the door!"""
text34621;"""Its sound didn't just annoy me — it seemed to make my nerves themselves strain and tighten like strings."""
text34622;"""Meanwhile, someone I never expected to see here entered the bar — it was Saya-chan with her classmates."""
text34623;"""She looked around, choosing a table, noticed me, whispered something to her girlfriends, and headed towards me with clear determination."""
text34624;"""What are you doing here?"""
text34625;"""That's what I should be asking you, Anokhin-san."""
text34626;"""She sat across from me quite unceremoniously and looked me right in the eye."""
text34627;"""What about me? I just dropped by for lunch. This place has wonderful ramen, by the way, my recommendation!"""
text34628;"""Her presence was making me uncomfortable, and I didn't even really know why. <w>Perhaps because of all the memories."""
text34629;"""Catherine was right about Himitsu at the time, and apparently, I started to feel ashamed again."""
text34630;"""And Saya was only making things worse!"""
text34631;"""But you weren't at school today."""
text34632;"""Keeping an eye on me? I'm flattered."""
text34633;"""Don't play dumb."""
text34634;"""You're also out early, judging by the time."""
text34635;"""Our classes are already over, for your interest."""
text34636;"""Oh!"""
text34637;"""I raised my eyebrows."""
text34638;"""Naturally, I wasn't interested at all."""
text34639;"""Himitsu was worried about you and went home."""
text34640;"""Why'd she worry about me? Here I am!"""
text34641;"""Anokhin-san…"""
text34642;"""Just call me Nick, I told you!"""
text34643;"""For some reason, coming from her in particular, these formalities were especially sickening."""
text34644;"""Anokhin-san, you know what I'm talking about."""
text34645;"""No, I don't. And even if I did, I don't think it's any of your business."""
text34646;"""Worrying about a friend is very much my business."""
text34647;"""I couldn't object…"""
text34648;"""In any case, you don't know all the details of our relationship."""
text34649;"""I don't see what <i>details</i> can matter when the relationship hurts one of the parties."""
text34650;"""I bit my lip and turned away, not even trying to hide my irritation."""
text34651;"""And now there's this foreigner girl too…"""
text34652;"""What about her?"""
text34653;"""I immediately looked back to Saya and grit my teeth, but she remained calm."""
text34654;"""Her return was quite timely. Now your life has no time left for Himitsu."""
text34655;"""Now that is definitely none of your business!"""
text34656;"""So you're not denying it?"""
text34657;"""I'm not going to get into a pointless argument with you."""
text34658;"""You don't need to argue with me, but think about Himitsu!"""
text34659;"""I do, okay?! I do!"""
text34660;"""I almost added \""all the time\""."""
text34661;"""What do you even know…"""
text34662;"""I let out a sigh and threw a greedy glance at the alcohol stand."""
text34663;"""2 o'clock is the perfect time."""
text34664;"""Saya smirked."""
text34665;"""Turns out she was also quite attentive."""
text34666;"""Sure, I knew it in my head that there was a fair bit of truth to her words, but I just couldn't agree. <w>If only for my own sake."""
text34667;"""Listening to you makes my ears bleed! A shot would make it at least bearable!"""
text34668;"""You're hopeless."""
text34669;"""Maybe that's exactly why Himitsu likes me — ever thought of that?"""
text34670;"""So you know it and keep acting like that?"""
text34671;"""Relax, I'm joking."""
text34672;"""There are things you can't joke about."""
text34673;"""Excuse me for not being a prude."""
text34674;"""Or having much of a conscience."""
text34675;"""Seriously, what do you want me to say?"""
text34676;"""Why do you act like that?"""
text34677;"""It's none of your business!"""
text34678;"""I'm going through a rough patch in life"""
text34679;"""What are you, my psychologist? A relative?"""
text34680;"""And whatever the case! You keep nagging at Himitsu about how terrible I am!"""
text34681;"""Saya's face visibly changed — she frowned and seemingly grew a couple years older."""
text34682;"""Will it make you happy if we fight? Do you think it'll make Himitsu feel better?!"""
text34683;"""What makes you think you know what's better for her?!"""
text34684;"""How long have you known her? A year, two years? I've known her for ten! Ten fucking years! That's a shitload of time!"""
text34685;"""I spread my arms, showing how much time that was exactly."""
text34686;"""You're sick. Himitsu must have terrible luck to be involved with such a jerk…"""
text34687;"""She stood up and headed for her girlfriends' table."""
text34688;"""Nice, piss off! At least she has a jerk, while you're surrounded by cows!"""
text34689;"""I said after her."""
text34690;"""And so is Himitsu. We've known each other since childhood, you know? We have a kind of… how do I say it… connection between us!"""
text34691;"""Ten years! That's no joke. Half our lives, more even!"""
text34692;"""Maybe you want the best for her, but it's not that simple."""
text34693;"""What's so difficult about her life? Don't you think you're the one making it difficult?"""
text34694;"""It's… a relationship! Things happen!"""
text34695;"""Relationship!"""
text34696;"""She smirked."""
text34697;"""That's an interesting choice of words, Anokhin-san. Although, alright, I won't bother you."""
text34698;"""She stood up and headed to her girlfriends."""
text34699;"""In reality, Saya hadn't said anything new and there wasn't any reason to be upset with her."""
text34700;"""Mostly, I was angry with myself — the girl had hit a sore spot."""
text34701;"""With great precision, I must say!"""
text34702;"""Meanwhile, Himitsu's classmates weren't in a hurry to leave."""
text34703;"""Having finished their milk cocktails and ice cream, they kept sitting there, chatting about casual stuff."""
text34704;"""I was throwing rare annoyed glances at them, but Saya was making a point to ignore me."""
text34705;"""To be honest, I simply found it hard to get up and walk past them to the exit."""
text34706;"""That would seemingly mean acknowledging my defeat and fleeing the battlefield."""
text34707;"""It was silly, but I kept sitting there to the bitter end, having chewed through even the chopsticks."""
text34708;"""Finally, their merry band got up from the table and prepared to leave."""
text34709;"""Saya shot me a farewell look, screwing her face into a snide grimace."""
text34710;"""She had to be thinking she won!"""
text34711;"""Jeez, Kolya, who was that?"""
text34712;"""The Bartender appeared next to me at once."""
text34713;"""If witch burning were still in fashion these days, I'd definitely report her to the Inquisition!"""
text34714;"""So that was…"""
text34715;"""Just a friend of Himitsu's."""
text34716;"""Aaah, I see!"""
text34717;"""He said thoughtfully and sat down beside me."""
text34718;"""No actually, I don't."""
text34719;"""Maybe that's for the better."""
text34720;"""I paid my bill and left the bar."""
text34721;"""I was having a hard time getting my emotions in order after the reprimanding Saya had given me."""
text34722;"""Sometimes you understand you're wrong, can even accept your mistakes somewhere deep inside, but if someone points them out you can't help but argue."""
text34723;"""Yet another crazy day was coming to an end."""
text34724;"""I got caught in the rain while on my way back home and barged into the kitchen defeated."""
text34725;"""And immediately faced Himitsu's disapproving stare."""
text34726;"""There's probably no point asking where you've been, Niko-kun?"""
text34727;"""Probably not."""
text34728;"""I agreed, trying not to sound rude, and walked past her."""
text34729;"""Gotta take a shower or I'll get sick."""
text34730;"""…"""
text34732;"""A hot dinner greeted me when I left the bathroom."""
text34733;"""After everything, I could only marvel at Himitsu's patience."""
text34734;"""\""Not everyone could put up with someone like you for that many years!\"""""
text34735;"""Couldn't have said it better myself."""
text34736;"""Sorry for disappearing today. I had to… had to think."""
text34737;"""Very well."""
text34738;"""What's well about it?"""
text34739;"""I'm glad that you had time to think."""
text34740;"""Yeah? Well, okay… By the way, I met Saya-chan at the bar today."""
text34741;"""Really?"""
text34742;"""Himitsu asked without much interest."""
text34743;"""I gotta say that she's… weird! Yeah, weird. And she could do without prying into other people's business."""
text34744;"""What does she pry into?"""
text34745;"""Well, you must know better than me. I don't know what she says about me, but…"""
text34746;"""Niko-kun, I'm capable of making my own decisions."""
text34747;"""She said in a bored voice."""
text34748;"""Of course! I didn't mean anything like that, it's just…"""
text34749;"""Ah, whatever! I'm not trying to say I have to like all of your friends."""
text34750;"""That's nice."""
text34751;"""We kept silent for a while."""
text34752;"""So, did all those thoughts bring you to any conclusions? Were they about Katty-chan?"""
text34753;"""No, no, of course not!"""
text34754;"""It felt like Himitsu would pretty much explode at any mention of Catherine."""
text34755;"""I mostly wanted to check if I'm being watched."""
text34756;"""So, are you?"""
text34757;"""Himitsu perked up."""
text34758;"""I don't know. Even if someone is watching, they're very good at it."""
text34759;"""Indeed, the Soviet intelligence agents, as well as the other players, hadn't shown themselves in any way in the past two days."""
text34760;"""That wasn't much of a timeframe to draw any broad conclusions, but it gave me at least some respite. <w>Just to sink ever deeper into my personal drama."""
text34761;"""For whatever reason, I couldn't bring myself to call our love triangle a melodrama."""
text34762;"""Maybe \""tragedy\"" was a better word for it."""
text34763;"""So what do you think?"""
text34764;"""I think that so far we're managing not to attract too much attention. And there's a good chance it'll stay like that."""
text34765;"""I really hope so!"""
text34766;"""So do I. I'm really sick of this uncertainty."""
text34767;"""Himitsu looked at me attentively but said nothing."""
text34768;"""By the way, the dinner was very good! Thank you."""
text34769;"""So, did you talk about me with Saya-chan?"""
text34770;"""Kind of. But you know her better than I. And you know everything she could tell me."""
text34771;"""I guess."""
text34772;"""Niko-kun, she really isn't a bad person, just a bit harsh sometimes. But it's not out of malice!"""
text34773;"""Good intentions pave the road to Hell, you know."""
text34774;"""Although she'd be more the gatekeeper, meeting new arrivals."""
text34775;"""Himitsu laughed, but quickly caught herself and frowned.<seq hi_hamster>"""
text34776;"""Hey!"""
text34777;"""I'm serious! On the other hand, she could also get an offer for Charon's job — would be much better than the original anyway. She'd entertain her passengers with her grumbling along the way."""
text34778;"""Can you imagine Saya-chan in a robe?"""
text34779;"""I pulled a towel over my head and made a face."""
text34780;"""Niko-kun, stop it!"""
text34781;"""She kept laughing."""
text34782;"""I jumped up from the bed, ran to her, and threw the towel over her face."""
text34783;"""You're doomed to endless suffering in Hell for having overdone <note=note126>the tofu</note>!"""
text34784;"""Niko-kun!"""
text34785;"""Himitsu kept desperately resisting and pushed me away."""
text34786;"""I lost my balance and fell to the floor, taking her with me."""
text34787;"""You dare, mortal?! You have the courage to oppose the will of Hades?!"""
text34788;"""For a while, we struggled, and soon I ended up atop Himitsu, holding her hands firmly in mine."""
text34789;"""Which would already be quite a precarious position to be in, but it was also exacerbated by the fact that Himitsu's face flushed and her hair scattered on the floor."""
text34790;"""We fell quiet simultaneously, and she no longer laughed."""
text34791;"""In the descendent silence, only the sound of our heartbeats could be heard."""
text34792;"""The tension even halted the air in my lungs."""
text34793;"""Niko-kun, I want…"""
text34794;"""I didn't play the fool and specify what exactly she wanted — I simply kept silent."""
text34795;"""Himitsu lay there unmoving still."""
text34796;"""Whatever happened now, she wouldn't take the initiative."""
text34797;"""But as bad luck would have it, I remembered Catherine again and that day in the park two years ago."""
text34798;"""I couldn't do this to Himitsu!"""
text34799;"""First I had to sort out myself and my feelings towards each of them."""
text34800;"""I let go of her hands and fell to the floor next to her."""
text34801;"""Sorry."""
text34802;"""What are you apologizing for?"""
text34803;"""She immediately, happily responded."""
text34804;"""I'd like to remind you that we've got school tomorrow!"""
text34805;"""Himitsu painfully pinched my side."""
text34806;"""Ouch!"""
text34807;"""Still, I was grateful for her tactfulness."""
text34808;"""That was yet another thing to add to the others I was grateful to her for."""
text34809;"""It's war then!"""
text34810;"""I grabbed a pillow."""
text34811;"""…"""
text34812;"""Exhausted, we were lying on the bed, resting."""
text34813;"""It was nine o'clock."""
text34814;"""It's so late already!"""
text34815;"""Himitsu suddenly realized."""
text34816;"""Wouldn't say it's particularly late."""
text34817;"""I still need to do homework for tomorrow, they gave us a lot. And someone made me so nervous today that I had other things on my mind."""
text34818;"""I wonder who that might've been."""
text34819;"""Alright, I'm leaving!"""
text34820;"""She stuck her tongue out at me and left, flashing a goodbye smile."""
text34821;"""When I was left alone, I took a deep breath and immediately felt overwhelmed."""
text34822;"""Without a prelude or a preface."""
text34823;"""I could've…"""
text34824;"""What am I doing?!"""
text34825;"""The sense of guilt was burning me from the inside."""
text34826;"""My broken heart joined the chorus, making my existence virtually unbearable."""
text34827;"""I seemed to be suffocating and burning at the same time, as if ending up in the real Hell."""
text34828;"""It was absolutely impossible to remain in silence and solitude anymore!"""
text34829;"""…"""
text34830;"""Hastily trudging through puddles, I reached the nightclub."""
text34831;"""My consciousness kicked in."""
text34832;"""I was sitting behind a table densely covered by beer mugs, shots, and rocks glasses, drowning in clouds of cigarette smoke."""
text34833;"""My thoughts were tumbling over each other, but my main goal had been achieved — I'd managed to calm down."""
text34834;"""Even if it was achieved this way — by drinking myself to unconsciousness."""
text34835;"""Some band was playing on the stage, but I wasn't in any condition to listen properly — the rhythmic drum of the speakers was more than enough."""
text34836;"""Suddenly an unfamiliar guy sat at my table and started to speak quickly."""
text34837;"""Although it was more like he was opening and closing his mouth, like a fish in water."""
text34838;"""Huh? What? I can't hear!"""
text34839;"""I moved closer."""
text34840;"""I'm saying it's nice to see a European here!"""
text34841;"""He said in English."""
text34842;"""I didn't even notice right away that he wasn't Japanese."""
text34843;"""Ah… Yeah."""
text34844;"""Where are you from?"""
text34845;"""I live nearby."""
text34846;"""No, I mean from what country?"""
text34847;"""USSR."""
text34848;"""I replied after a pause."""
text34849;"""My perception of reality was significantly clouded by alcohol, but I still didn't count on Kobayashi Corporation and the KGB suddenly leaving me alone."""
text34850;"""And I'm…"""
text34851;"""He said where he was from, but I couldn't hear and decided not to ask again."""
text34852;"""Ed!"""
text34853;"""The guy stretched his hand out to me."""
text34854;"""\""Ed\"" what?"""
text34855;"""My name's Ed! What's yours?"""
text34856;"""Nick."""
text34857;"""I shook his hand."""
text34858;"""You come here often?"""
text34859;"""Sometimes."""
text34860;"""I'd guess he was slightly over 20, but all in all, Ed possessed an absolutely forgettable appearance."""
text34861;"""Were I to be interrogated the next day, I wouldn't be able to name any characteristics — no long hair, no big nose, no scars or birthmarks."""
text34862;"""You could say it was a very fitting appearance for a spy. <w>Or an intelligence officer, depending on your perspective."""
text34863;"""I'm here on tour with my favorite band…"""
text34864;"""He shouted the name so loudly that it even overpowered the buzzing of the guitars, but I still couldn't make it out."""
text34865;"""They're headlining today!"""
text34866;"""Yeah…"""
text34867;"""He seemed to be just a regular music fan rather than a spy."""
text34868;"""I downed the shot of whisky courteously offered by Ed, then another one, and the guy quickly began to seem like the a wonderful person."""
text34869;"""Listen, Ed…"""
text34870;"""I was tripping over my tongue, but a drunk always understands another drunk — they're on the same page, so to say."""
text34871;"""Do you have someone? I mean, a girl…"""
text34872;"""Yeah, my wife is waiting for me at home."""
text34873;"""Wife? So serious? I see…"""
text34874;"""And you?"""
text34875;"""And me…"""
text34876;"""I sighed and downed half a glass of beer in one go."""
text34877;"""Hell knows what's going on in my life! I may even have two, hah!"""
text34878;"""Well, I mean, not two wives… Two girls. And I don't know who to choose."""
text34879;"""What does your heart tell you?"""
text34880;"""Heart? Is it ever that easy?! That only works in books! Stupid books!"""
text34881;"""Okay, let's try a different approach: which of them seems to be the lesser evil?"""
text34882;"""What do you mean...?"""
text34883;"""I asked, startled."""
text34884;"""Ed turned out to be less drunk than me after all."""
text34885;"""Well, which choice would make you lose less? Which choice would harm others less?"""
text34886;"""Well, if you put it this way…"""
text34887;"""Catherine can live without me, for sure! She's been doing alright the last year and a half!"""
text34888;"""But Himitsu… Well, I wouldn't say she'd off herself, but… Who knows though!"""
text34889;"""Is it that serious?"""
text34890;"""He asked compassionately."""
text34891;"""No, it's just… in the context of this discussion, you know? Ah…"""
text34892;"""From what you've said, it seems like this Himitsu is just dependent on you."""
text34893;"""Dependent? No way! We're not like…"""
text34894;"""It's a term in psychology. You, on the other hand, are dependent on Catherine!"""
text34895;"""I'm not dependent on anyone!"""
text34896;"""I felt resentment growing inside of me."""
text34897;"""I'm just trying to help, bro, cool down! Better get another round!"""
text34898;"""And what does your psychology suggest to do in my case?"""
text34899;"""I asked, after giving his words a a bit of thought."""
text34900;"""Getting rid of the dependency."""
text34901;"""By \""getting rid\"" of the dependency, you mean the way they usually do it in Holywood films? Think I should shoot Catherine?"""
text34902;"""I laughed loudly."""
text34903;"""But then Himitsu would have to shoot me!"""
text34904;"""In reality, there was nothing funny about that, especially in my situation."""
text34905;"""Especially considering that I could actually catch a bullet at any moment."""
text34906;"""There are easier ways. For example, visiting a psychologist."""
text34907;"""A psychologist? Are you serious? I'm going to tell him that…"""
text34908;"""Catherine's mother was involved in my parents' death and I'm hunted by the most powerful corporation in Japan, but I can't think about anything but love, simultaneously feeling guilty about my childhood friend who has also built a dependency on me?"""
text34909;"""No, I couldn't say that!"""
text34910;"""It might be a good idea though. They'd send me to the mad house right off!"""
text34911;"""I'd definitely be safe there!"""
text34912;"""You're taking it too close to heart, making a tree out of a molehill!"""
text34913;"""What? No! Ed, I think you're shitfaced!"""
text34914;"""His mistake entertained me a lot and distracted me from my dark thoughts."""
text34915;"""Well, I'm still doing better than you!"""
text34916;"""I guess so — you are older! Although, I… I'm trying to become a worthy alcomarathoner!"""
text34917;"""Not bad, but be careful with that, otherwise you might never reach the finish line."""
text34918;"""We all reach the finish line, one way or another! Just the distance is different for everyone."""
text34919;"""Suddenly, the crowd grew silent and, after some time, an intro from a famous song came out from the speakers."""
text34920;"""Oh, here they are! Let's go to the stage!"""
text34921;"""I did know this band, which made me even more surprised to see them at such a mediocre club."""
text34922;"""The furious energy of the music and the roaring crowd soon washed over me and made me forget about my problems."""
text34923;"""…"""
text34924;"""When the performance was over, I even sobered up a bit, but Ed approached me immediately with a couple of beer cans in his hands."""
text34925;"""Here, try this! It's a brand one, we brought some with us!"""
text34926;"""I took a few gulps, and that was just enough — the concert hall started to blur before my eyes."""
text34927;"""You know, Ed, you're a cool guy! Really cool! Pity, there are no such guys here! You know… If you want, we can continue at my place! An afterparty, so to say!"""
text34928;"""I'd like to, but I still need to help the band load their equipment."""
text34929;"""Then I'll help as well!"""
text34930;"""I tried to stand up but instead fell to the floor, and immediately burst out laughing."""
text34931;"""Whoops, I seem to be having trouble navigating!"""
text34932;"""The next words Ed said to me seemed to sound from somewhere far away, like the yell of a captain of a ship passing by in the fog:"""
text34933;"""Sit here for a bit, we'll drive you home!"""
text34934;"""I will… Why not!"""
text34935;"""I barely managed to climb on the chair and started to look for booze."""
text34936;"""And, of course, I found it soon..."""

text20246;"""I woke up covered in sweat, with Ellie snuffling peacefully next to me."""
text20247;"""The innocent expression on her face made the memories of us going through the whole bag of powder seem like a terrible dream."""
text20248;"""The clock was saying two-ish PM, which meant we had successfully skipped school."""
text20249;"""Well, what started as spending the night at my place has now turned to truancy."""
text20250;"""I was methodically going against everything Kobayashi Jun wanted from me, driving into the abyss with the gas pedal pressed to the floor."""
text20251;"""And scariest of all was that without me, Ellie would most likely have at least maintained the illusion of decency without tumbling into outright antisocial behavior."""
text20252;"""I carefully got up, trying not to wake her, and felt something weird — completely different from a hangover."""
text20253;"""Suddenly my body became light, my legs turned to jelly, and I lost my balance."""
text20254;"""I snagged the guitar and, letting out a displeased twang, it fell to the side."""
text20255;"""Mmm…"""
text20256;"""Ellie stretched sweetly and opened her eyes."""
text20257;"""Is it morning already?"""
text20258;"""Afternoon, two o'clock."""
text20259;"""I muttered."""
text20260;"""I was starving — the last time I'd had anything was lunch yesterday, and it'd been almost a full day since then."""
text20261;"""Do you want breakfast? I'm about to starve to death!"""
text20262;"""What day is… <seq el_shocked>Aaaah!"""
text20263;"""She immediately jumped out of the bed and started putting her clothes on."""
text20264;"""We have a rehearsal today!"""
text20265;"""Do what you want, but I'm not going anywhere until I eat."""
text20266;"""Just make it quick."""
text20267;"""She frowned, trying to button her shirt."""
text20268;"""…"""
text20269;"""The engine that usually powered the rotor of my thought process seemed to have been stopped dead by something."""
text20270;"""We were walking down the street, and I couldn't focus on a single thought."""
text20271;"""Sometimes if felt like I spent long minutes just moving my legs, step after step, on autopilot, not thinking about a thing."""
text20272;"""Ellie looked a bit better — but also quite rough."""
text20273;"""Dose every time feel like… this?"""
text20274;"""Well…"""
text20275;"""She said and stared down at her feet, as if she was walking on ice."""
text20276;"""If you knew we had a group rehearsal today, why did you…"""
text20277;"""It just happened."""
text20278;"""Oh, it <i>just happened</i>…"""
text20279;"""Under different circumstances, I'd have picked my words more carefully to avoid upsetting her but here it seemed meaningless."""
text20280;"""Just like how after a sleepless night you don't care whether your tie matches your suit."""
text20281;"""Good thing Ellie's bodyguards hadn't come in to check whether we were still alive."""
text20282;"""I always had a feeling they were somewhere close, watching the house."""
text20283;"""Well, what do you want me to say?"""
text20284;"""That you won't do it anymore?"""
text20285;"""I knew how useless the promise would be."""
text20286;"""Every hangover I too would swear to myself that I'd never drink again."""
text20287;"""But I had to handle this quickly, even if not immediately."""
text20288;"""Just the thought that her bodyguards might notice the state we were in terrified me."""
text20289;"""My battered nervous system was starting to fail, and I felt myself start to sweat intensely."""
text20290;"""Nick, are you alright?"""
text20291;"""I don't know."""
text20292;"""What if it was a heart attack?"""
text20293;"""I stopped, resting my hand against a wall."""
text20294;"""My went got dark, and my heart started racing."""
text20295;"""It felt like my chest was tied with a tight belt, every breath took an enormous effort."""
text20296;"""I looked at my hands and couldn't understand what was happening — it was like looking at the world from outside myself, like there was a TV screen broadcasting my life."""
text20297;"""Hold on!"""
text20298;"""Ellie ran to a vending machine full of drinks and bought a bottle of water."""
text20299;"""Here, drink."""
text20300;"""I really was thirsty like I'd just run ten kilometers without stopping."""
text20301;"""I emptied the entire bottle in one go."""
text20302;"""Thank you."""
text20303;"""Better now?"""
text20304;"""I don't know."""
text20305;"""I listened to my senses and found that the panic did seem to have faded a little."""
text20306;"""Let's go?"""
text20307;"""Let's go…"""
text20308;"""I didn't want to show weakness — not as much to her as to myself."""
text20309;"""However that feeling of losing control over the situation frightened me."""
text20310;"""Did I really control anything in my own life?"""
text20311;"""…"""
text20312;"""By the time we reached the studio, we found that the other members of Z FEEL-Z had started without us."""
text20313;"""We were thinking you wouldn't come!"""
text20314;"""Ishida greeted us cheerfully, but his demeanor quickly soured as he noticed our battered condition."""
text20315;"""You aren't coming from school?"""
text20316;"""I was about to reply but Ellie was faster:"""
text20317;"""Sure we are. See — I'm wearing my uniform."""
text20318;"""Although her uniform wasn't exactly neat, to put it mildly."""
text20319;"""It seemed that soon the wardrobes that had gone empty after my parents' death would be filled with female clothes again."""
text20320;"""Except she missed the fact that I was just wearing jeans and a sweater."""
text20321;"""I skipped though."""
text20322;"""I sighed to not ruin the story."""
text20323;"""…"""
text20324;"""The panic that had come over me on the street seemed like nothing but a memory now, but the surreal feeling to everything around me made it hard to focus on playing music."""
text20325;"""It seemed that there was a pilot in my head, controlling my body like it was a robot."""
text20326;"""No matter how skillful he was, some delay and inaccuracy was inevitable."""
text20327;"""We played awfully."""
text20328;"""I noticed it, and so did everyone else."""
text20329;"""Alright, let's take a lunch break."""
text20330;"""Ishida finally put the guitar away."""
text20331;"""You guys can go, Nick and I have eaten already."""
text20332;"""Yes, but…"""
text20333;"""I would've grabbed a bite too, but Ellie apparently wanted something with me."""
text20334;"""Once we were left alone, she took out a small bag full of powder without a moment's hesitation."""
text20335;"""Another one?"""
text20336;"""It must've been the one I'd taken from her yesterday."""
text20337;"""I decided not to ask when she managed to take it out of my pocket."""
text20338;"""Want some recovery juice?"""
text20339;"""Again?"""
text20340;"""I exclaimed but felt far less confident in my indignation than yesterday."""
text20341;"""A bottle of beer really does help with a hangover — and I could definitely use some help."""
text20342;"""You do realize this is an addiction now, right?"""
text20343;"""I'm not saying we should… go like yesterday."""
text20344;"""She pouted like a little girl accused of stealing candy from the cupboard."""
text20345;"""See, we're not getting anywhere today. But if we have just a bit of this, we'll be fine!"""
text20346;"""I felt bile rise in my throat."""
text20347;"""You know, I was just thinking that <i>I</i> was a bad influence on <i>you</i>!"""
text20348;"""Sorry to disappoint."""
text20349;"""Ellie smiled and came closer, waving the bag in front of my nose."""
text20350;"""The memories of the euphoria I'd felt yesterday made it so much harder to refuse."""
text20351;"""Accept"""
text20352;"""Fine but just a little bit!"""
text20353;"""We quickly refueled, the other guys soon returning."""
text20354;"""Apparently, the doping worked — I spent the rest of the rehearsal playing much better."""
text20355;"""Refuse"""
text20356;"""No, and I don't think you should either."""
text20357;"""I can decide for myself."""
text20358;"""Ellie scoffed unhappily but put the bag away."""
text20359;"""Soon, other members returned from lunch."""
text20360;"""Even without any doping, I soon felt better and played more or less okay for the rest of the rehearsal, considering my mediocre skill level."""
text20361;"""When we walked out to the street it was already evening, but my internal clock stubbornly asserted that it was lunch time."""
text20362;"""Does anybody want to… get a bite? I know a bar nearby."""
text20363;"""Why not."""
text20364;"""Mitsuyoshi shrugged his shoulders."""
text20365;"""Yeah, good idea. We can discuss the concert, too."""
text20366;"""Ellie didn't mind either, and Tokyo Rider took us all for a ride in his expensive sports car."""
text20367;"""(How did he have so much money?!)"""
text20368;"""…"""
text20369;"""At that time of day, almost all the tables in the bar were occupied, but the Bartender still managed to find us a place."""
text20370;"""Brought friends along today, Kolya?"""
text20371;"""Yeah, this is… my band."""
text20372;"""I replied hesitantly, as if embarrassed about something."""
text20373;"""A band? Really? Cool, seriously cool! Let me shake a musician's hand!"""
text20374;"""When we got seated, I immediately said:"""
text20375;"""Sorry about the Bartender — sometimes he goes overboard with hospitality."""
text20376;"""Is he from your homeland?"""
text20377;"""Yeah, something like that."""
text20378;"""If I were asked to name the worst representatives of their respective peoples, I would immediately name the Bartender and Kyosuke."""
text20379;"""Although, of course, their particular clumsiness and inability to understand the context of a situation were more than compensated for by the size of their souls."""
text20380;"""Not many options in this place."""
text20381;"""Mitsuyoshi was carefully studying the menu."""
text20382;"""They serve fine ramen. And beer."""
text20383;"""I sneaked a glance at Ellie — she was sitting on her chair with a bored look."""
text20384;"""I have to work night shift."""
text20385;"""And I'm driving."""
text20386;"""I think I'll pass on that, too."""
text20387;"""I suddenly felt like an alcoholic just because I even mentioned beer."""
text20388;"""In the end, everyone chose something to their liking."""
text20389;"""I ordered a burger and a bottle of cola."""
text20390;"""So, about the concert."""
text20391;"""Ishida ate at most half of his ramen and set the bowl aside."""
text20392;"""Even though there's still half a week left, it'll be Nick's first concert and a good chance to make a name for ourselves."""
text20393;"""I talked to the manager of the club, and he said there'll be a guy from a record label."""
text20394;"""If we don't screw up, it'll be a great chance for us to finally release a demo!"""
text20395;"""You think it'll work? We won't be the only ones performing there."""
text20396;"""I'm not saying he'll offer us a contract."""
text20397;"""Ishida gave us an impatient look."""
text20398;"""In the worst case, we'll record at our own expense."""
text20399;"""Yeah, money isn't a problem…"""
text20400;"""No, El."""
text20401;"""He said strictly."""
text20402;"""We agreed from the beginning that the band was a shared project. We perform together, and we handle the expenses together. In equal parts."""
text20403;"""Do you agree, Nick?"""
text20404;"""I do…"""
text20405;"""The situation forced me to agree, but deep inside I saw nothing wrong with Ellie bearing a slightly larger part of the expenses."""
text20406;"""For once Kobayashi Corporation's money could serve a good cause."""
text20407;"""Besides, we aren't talking about an astronomical amount of money here."""
text20408;"""My first demo…"""
text20409;"""Ellie muttered dreamily."""
text20410;"""I wonder what the cover will be?"""
text20411;"""I'm more interested in the songs that will be in it. How long is a demo usually? About twenty minutes?"""
text20412;"""Or less."""
text20413;"""So only three or four songs?"""
text20414;"""He sighed in disappointment."""
text20415;"""Well, it's demo. The point is to show what we're capable of. A full-fledged album would come later."""
text20416;"""A full album!"""
text20417;"""Ellie and Mitsuyoshi exhaled in unison."""
text20418;"""As for me, I listened to the conversation feeling like a secretary invited to a board meeting, given five minutes to do a presentation, and then forgotten in a corner."""
text20419;"""Guys, come back to reality! We haven't even performed yet, and you're already making plans."""
text20420;"""Jeez, like we can't even dream some."""
text20421;"""Dream as much as you want, just don't forget about reality."""
text20422;"""Ellie suddenly frowned."""
text20423;"""What are you talking about?"""
text20424;"""Had they had a conversation about Ellie's addiction before?"""
text20425;"""Nothing really…"""
text20426;"""But Ishida backed off."""
text20427;"""I just want to say that we all need to take preparation for this concert seriously."""
text20428;"""I'm always prepared."""
text20429;"""Tokyo Rider said suddenly, and an awkward silence descended upon our table."""
text20430;"""We don't doubt you."""
text20431;"""Ishida finally broke it."""
text20432;"""We don't doubt anyone. And definitely not Nick! Right, Nick?"""
text20433;"""I couldn't quite understand if she was joking, taunting, or teasing."""
text20434;"""Share some of your confidence with me."""
text20435;"""I can share something else."""
text20436;"""Alllright, I gotta go to work!"""
text20437;"""Ishida stood up sharply like something had bitten his ass."""
text20438;"""There had to be something in Z FEEL-Z's past I was yet to learn about."""
text20439;"""…"""
text20440;"""Ishida was the first to leave, and we said goodbye to Mitsuyoshi and Tokyo Rider outside."""
text20441;"""I felt better, but was extremely tired."""
text20442;"""That prophylactic dose had already worn off."""
text20443;"""I felt pretty bad, and deep inside regretted rejecting Ellie's offer."""
text20444;"""Say, Ellie…"""
text20445;"""The question wouldn't leave my head, and I couldn't bear staying quiet."""
text20446;"""Do they know about…"""
text20447;"""Jesus, Nick, stop taking me for an idiot!"""
text20448;"""I'm just asking."""
text20449;"""She stopped and raised her head, as if looking for something in the sky."""
text20450;"""Maybe…"""
text20451;"""<i>Maybe</i> what?"""
text20452;"""That's the answer to your question. Maybe they do."""
text20453;"""She said calmly."""
text20454;"""Before meeting you I'd never thought that this sort of <i>thing</i> was… bad."""
text20455;"""But now…"""
text20456;"""She turned around and looked pleadingly into my eyes."""
text20457;"""If you want me to, I'll never do it again!"""
text20458;"""Did I really want that? <w>With my heart and soul?"""
text20459;"""Ellie…"""
text20460;"""I was overwhelmed by emotion, and hugged her tightly and kissed her."""
text20461;"""Let's go home?"""
text20462;"""She suddenly broke out of my embrace and ran a couple of steps away."""
text20463;"""Not today. I need to go home at least occasionally. Otherwise grandpa will misunderstand."""
text20464;"""Right, sorry."""
text20465;"""See you at school tomorrow. I haven't forgotten about it."""
text20466;"""Bye…"""
text20467;"""Ellie waved goodbye and ran to the car parked nearby."""
text20468;"""If her bodyguards were around all the time, the situation wasn't just dangerous, it was catastrophic!"""
text20469;"""Not only had I climbed the highest tree around, I was even sawing away at the branch I was sitting on."""
text20470;"""If you want me to, I'll never do it again!"""
text20471;"""What mattered most was that Ellie wouldn't forget those words tomorrow!"""
text20472;"""I was walking home in a grim state of mind."""
text20473;"""The first bout of drowsiness had already passed, but my body seemed to have switched to energy saving mode, my brain being the first organ to suffer."""
text20474;"""I only noticed somebody sitting on the porch when I almost bumped into him."""
text20475;"""Or rather, into her. <w>Kagome was sitting on my porch."""
text20476;"""What are you doing here?"""
text20477;"""She opened her eyes wide, as if genuinely surprised by my reaction and the fact I was even here."""
text20478;"""Aren't you happy to see me?"""
text20479;"""I wasn't expecting you. Let's go inside."""
text20480;"""Sure, logically Ellie's guards wouldn't be watching the house when she wasn't there, but I still preferred not to risk it."""
text20481;"""…"""
text20482;"""My eyes were closing by themselves, and I was fighting the desperate desire to make some tea."""
text20483;"""I wanted to quickly find out what Kagome wanted from me and finally go to sleep."""
text20484;"""You have my full attention."""
text20485;"""She walked around the table, running her hand over its top as if choosing a piece of furniture in a shop — and there was something suspicious about that estimating gesture."""
text20486;"""We better not talk at school — I get that. Anyone who starts a conversation with me would get strange looks. Like I'm contagious."""
text20487;"""You know, you're partially to blame for that."""
text20488;"""Oh, really?"""
text20489;"""She raised an eyebrow and finally sat down."""
text20490;"""You did everything in your power to make them suspect you. Why are you surprised when that's exactly what happened?"""
text20491;"""No matter how long someone innocent pretends to be guilty, they don't become it."""
text20492;"""That's a nice bit of sophistry."""
text20493;"""I took my head into my hands and leaned heavily against the wall."""
text20494;"""Kind of."""
text20495;"""Kagome smiled mysteriously."""
text20496;"""I just wanted to say thank you."""
text20497;"""For what?"""
text20498;"""For not spending the rest of my life in prison. For the fact that <i>they</i> let my father go."""
text20499;"""I don't have anything to do with that. You better thank Ellie."""
text20500;"""And you weren't very friendly with her yesterday."""
text20501;"""You think so?"""
text20502;"""If I hadn't been so tired, I most likely wouldn't have said any of this."""
text20503;"""After all, Ellie wasn't directly related to what had happened to Kagome and her father."""
text20504;"""I wonder how come they let you go so easily."""
text20505;"""So you really have nothing to do with it?"""
text20506;"""She asked without a hint of anger, but I stayed silent."""
text20507;"""Maybe they got an order from above, or maybe… I don't know."""
text20508;"""I see."""
text20509;"""And that's it?"""
text20510;"""What else? Sorry, I'm very tired."""
text20511;"""That's obvious enough. After all, you haven't been to school today."""
text20512;"""…"""
text20513;"""Your relationship with Kobayashi is developing, I can see."""
text20514;"""If you're going to…"""
text20515;"""No, no! On the contrary, I wanted to say that I've thought about it a lot and decided I haven't been fair to her."""
text20516;"""Thought a lot, have you…"""
text20517;"""Prison's a good place to think, you know."""
text20518;"""How long did you spend there, three days?"""
text20519;"""I smirked and walked across the room in order not to fall asleep standing up."""
text20520;"""Enough to understand something."""
text20521;"""<i>Something</i>?"""
text20522;"""We don't choose our family and upbringing — this inheritance stays with you forever and influences your entire life."""
text20523;"""Right, so?"""
text20524;"""Maybe Kobayashi doesn't realize what she's doing."""
text20525;"""And what is she doing?"""
text20526;"""In the end, Ellie had done Kagome no wrong, at least personally."""
text20527;"""Iwamura only frowned in response."""
text20528;"""You seem to be a bit fixated on Ellie."""
text20529;"""Forget it."""
text20530;"""She responded angrily and stood up."""
text20531;"""Everything is back to normal, thank God!"""
text20532;"""I exclaimed joyfully, flinging my arms into the air."""
text20533;"""Kagome looked like she was about to explode at any second but suddenly relaxed."""
text20534;"""You're right, that's not why I'm here."""
text20535;"""Maybe even such a short stay in prison didn't help my manners."""
text20536;"""You mean they treated you badly there?"""
text20537;"""Not really…"""
text20538;"""I suppressed the desire to ask for details about the conditions in Japanese prisons, or detention facilities, or wherever she had been."""
text20539;"""Well, Niko-san, thank you again."""
text20540;"""Uh-huh, any time…"""
text20541;"""I grumbled without repeating that I had nothing to do with it."""
text20542;"""If there was anyone to thank here, it'd be Kobayashi Jun. <w>As if he cared about some girl!"""
text20543;"""Don't worry — I won't bother you… two at school."""
text20544;"""Very considerate of you."""
text20545;"""Before leaving my place, Kagome looked around as if she'd forgotten something important."""
text20546;"""Then I better go. Goodnight, Niko-san."""
text20547;"""Goodnight…"""
text20548;"""For some reason, I saw Iwamura to the gate."""
text20549;"""After she disappeared from sight, I felt like a weight had fallen from my shoulders."""
text20550;"""Finally I could go to sleep!"""
text20551;"""But before that I long stared at the sky that for some reason looked unusually clear tonight, the stars particularly bright."""
text20552;"""I suddenly imagined myself standing at the bottom of the sea, looking up at the myriad small fish swimming near the surface, glistening beautifully in the rays of the sun."""
text20553;"""Like stars."""
text20554;"""I went back inside, closed the door, and, completely exhausted, dragged myself to my room."""
text20555;"""Still, her politeness, courtesy, and even friendliness were bizarre."""
text20556;"""Did she really believe I had helped her evade prison?"""
text20557;"""Sure, to a degree my actions had helped indirectly, but I had zero desire to overestimate my own importance."""
text20558;"""Kagome remained a mystery girl, and no difficulties or strokes of misfortune seemed to be able to change her personality."""
text20559;"""Whether it was a good personality was a another question entirely, but deep inside I envied her resilience."""

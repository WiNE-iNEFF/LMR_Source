text15972;"""I was dreaming about music."""
text15973;"""It happens sometimes: you sit at a piano and play a marvelous melody."""
text15974;"""I couldn't play the piano, but in my dream it was so effortless it seemed like I'd been doing it my entire life."""
text15975;"""There's only one issue with dreams like that — when you wake up, you can't recall a single note."""
text15976;"""That morning the entire world seemed somewhat surreal."""
text15977;"""Nothing particularly unusual had ever happened in my life."""
text15978;"""My parents had brought me to Japan when I was still too little."""
text15979;"""You couldn't consider my relationship with Catherine something outstanding, right?"""
text15980;"""Most teenagers go through romantic turmoil of one kind or another, and every single one of them thinks their love in particular is uniquely special!"""
text15981;"""But playing in a band… <w>Especially a band like this!"""
text15982;"""I could barely explain even to myself what was so unique about Z FEEL-Z apart from the fact that Ellie played in it."""
text15983;"""Not that I needed to: your first band is like your first love!"""
text15984;"""Showering, getting dressed, cooking and eating breakfast, I couldn't stop thinking about the upcoming rehearsal."""
text15985;"""At least I could forget about the Corporation and the KGB for today."""
text15986;"""Was I supposed to take my bass guitar even if they had better ones?"""
text15987;"""I stared at it for while but eventually gave up on the idea:"""
text15988;"""Sorry, friend, another time…"""
text15989;"""…"""
text15990;"""I reached the studio by half past eleven, but the door was already open."""
text15991;"""Ishida and Mitsuyoshi were inside."""
text15992;"""Hey! Decided to join us after all?"""
text15993;"""Yeah, if you'll have me."""
text15994;"""Why would you need our permission? It'll all up to the princess."""
text15995;"""The princess?"""
text15996;"""They exchanged looks and laughed idiotically."""
text15997;"""Yeah, you know, we call El that sometimes."""
text15998;"""I see…"""
text15999;"""The pause dragged on."""
text16000;"""I decided not to bring my guitar along, is that alright?"""
text16001;"""No problem. You were comfortable enough playing ours yesterday, right?"""
text16002;"""Pretty much."""
text16003;"""Good then."""
text16004;"""I heard steps from behind the door, and Tokyo Rider entered the room."""
text16005;"""I didn't doubt for a second that I'd meet you here this morning!"""
text16006;"""We were all hoping you'd come too."""
text16007;"""I'm just in a good mood today."""
text16008;"""Or maybe we have a rehearsal."""
text16009;"""I hadn't felt comfortable and couldn't relax around these guys yesterday, it was like I'd accidentally walked into the wrong party."""
text16010;"""No one there would pay any attention to you — you could drink or try starting a conversation, but you'd know you don't belong."""
text16011;"""But things seemed to have changed: I could feel that I was, if not welcomed with open arms, at least not considered a stranger."""
text16012;"""Ellie arrived around half past twelve."""
text16013;"""Sorry I'm late!"""
text16014;"""Hi Nick! Good to see you."""
text16015;"""Hi. Good to see you too…"""
text16016;"""While looking at her, I suddenly felt a change in our relationship as well."""
text16017;"""We were no longer just schoolmates but now bandmates."""
text16018;"""Would I fit in? Would I play well with the group, did I have the skill?"""
text16019;"""Time would tell, sure, but at that moment I was ready to put in every effort to stay with them for as long as possible!"""
text16020;"""Alright, let's not just stand here and get playing!"""
text16021;"""For starters, we played same song as yesterday."""
text16022;"""The time spent practicing at home hadn't been in vain — I was far more confident with the strings."""
text16023;"""After a few attempts, Mitsuyoshi said:"""
text16024;"""Yeah, there we go!"""
text16025;"""A couple times it seemed to me that Ellie was giving me a weird look while we were playing."""
text16026;"""Possibly just because of my sharpened perception and focus on the instrument…"""
text16027;"""She showed me a part from another song of theirs."""
text16028;"""That one turned out to be more difficult, but more or less within my current ability."""
text16029;"""While I was sitting in the corner learning it, the others played covers of various Western hits."""
text16030;"""Oh, I know this one!"""
text16031;"""I managed to join in for a couple of them."""
text16032;"""The rehearsal lasted for several hours without a break, and, to be frank, I was quite tired by the end."""
text16033;"""Ellie, on the contrary, didn't even break a sweat."""
text16034;"""Finally, Tokyo Rider squeezed a siren-like sound out of the synth and exclaimed:"""
text16035;"""Lunchtime!"""
text16036;"""Lunchtime it is."""
text16037;"""Ishida shrugged."""
text16038;"""Mitsuyoshi stood up from his drums and wiped the sweat off his forehead — he'd definitely earned the right to take a break."""
text16039;"""Where do you want to eat?"""
text16040;"""I've got a bento."""
text16041;"""Me too."""
text16042;"""Don't even look at me!"""
text16043;"""Nick?"""
text16044;"""No, no bento today."""
text16045;"""Me neither. Let's go find a restaurant or something?"""
text16046;"""Let's go."""
text16047;"""…"""
text16048;"""We had what was to my taste very average ramen, and I was surprised to find that, first, Ellie ate that sort of thing, and second that she enjoyed it."""
text16049;"""You're quiet today."""
text16050;"""She said on the way back."""
text16051;"""Just focused on the music. Don't want to get kicked out after my first rehearsal."""
text16052;"""I hope it's not about my grandfather?"""
text16053;"""You know, I won't lie: it's hard to pretend that nothing's happened after the head of Kobayashi Corporation calls you to his office."""
text16054;"""But you came today, didn't you?"""
text16055;"""She said wistfully and looked me in the eye."""
text16056;"""Yeah, I did come today…"""
text16057;"""I didn't want to say why. <w>I didn't completely understand it myself."""
text16058;"""I hope granddad won't bother you anymore."""
text16059;"""And if he does — make sure to tell me!"""
text16060;"""I will."""
text16061;"""We returned to the studio, where Ishida was tuning his guitar, Mitsuyoshi was dozing off, leaning against a wall, and Tokyo Rider was flipping through the pages of a car magazine."""
text16062;"""Finally! We thought you weren't coming back!"""
text16063;"""Ishida, show some tact."""
text16064;"""Tact?"""
text16065;"""Enough already!"""
text16066;"""Ellie grew embarrassed."""
text16067;"""How long do you usually practice for?"""
text16068;"""Depends."""
text16069;"""Sometimes all the way until evening on weekends."""
text16070;"""…"""
text16071;"""After an hour of non-stop play, I had the feeling I'd faint if I had to play another second."""
text16072;"""Half an hour after that I found my second wind."""
text16073;"""And after two hours, I felt like I'd become one with the bass, its neck a continuation of my left hand: and there I was, not just trying to hold the right frets, but effortlessly bending and moving my fingers — the instrument obediently responding with the notes I needed."""
text16074;"""At first I carefully followed the rhythm, trying not to be even a millisecond off, but now my right hand strummed like a well-tuned machine."""
text16075;"""Have you tried using a pick?"""
text16076;"""Ishida asked during one of our few breaks."""
text16077;"""I have, but I feel like the sound gets artificial, or something, when you can't feel the strings."""
text16078;"""Well, maybe… But you also get more variety."""
text16079;"""If I need it for…"""
text16080;"""No, no, you're doing well!"""
text16081;"""He smiled."""
text16082;"""…"""
text16083;"""It was indeed well into the evening when we finished."""
text16084;"""I'd never felt that tired, even after playing football for hours."""
text16085;"""Thanks everyone, I gotta fly!"""
text16086;"""Tokyo Rider was the first to leave the studio."""
text16087;"""I should go. See you soon guys."""
text16088;"""Me too."""
text16089;"""Mitsuyoshi and Ishida left together."""
text16090;"""Why's everyone is such a hurry…?"""
text16091;"""I remarked without a second thought, <seq el_shy>but Ellie immediately blushed."""
text16092;"""They must be busy. Let's go?"""
text16093;"""We walked outside, where the bright street lights contrasting against the dark of the night left me blind a moment."""
text16094;"""Feeling strange?"""
text16095;"""A bit."""
text16096;"""Don't worry, you'll get used to it."""
text16097;"""I hope so."""
text16098;"""You know, Nick, I'm very grateful! We wouldn't be able to find anyone else to play bass in such a short time!"""
text16099;"""To be honest, I was having trouble believing that."""
text16100;"""Several folded sheets of paper with my parts of songs sat in my pocket — if they were counting on <i>me</i> to learn them before the next rehearsal, then anyone could do it."""
text16101;"""It's fate."""
text16102;"""I grinned."""
text16103;"""Fate?"""
text16104;"""Think about it: just a week ago, I saw Z FEEL-Z play for the first time, and now I've become your bass player…"""
text16105;"""Fate…"""
text16106;"""She said wistfully."""
text16107;"""Do you believe in fate?"""
text16108;"""No, actually. I'm more a fan of the idea that our actions shape the future."""
text16109;"""I've never really thought about this…"""
text16110;"""You were right not to. It's always better to put your efforts outwards."""
text16111;"""You're so smart."""
text16112;"""I missed a step and stared at her, unable to figure out if that was irony or not."""
text16113;"""Woe from wit…"""
text16114;"""What?"""
text16115;"""It's the name of a book by a Russian writer, he lived in the 19th century."""
text16116;"""I haven't read it."""
text16117;"""The conversation had clearly taken a wrong turn and was about to drop dead."""
text16118;"""I would've never had this problem when communicating with Himitsu or Catherine."""
text16119;"""I probably wouldn't have it with Kagome either — we'd be too busy arguing to find any time for silence."""
text16120;"""Why is it that when you don't know a person well, every prolonged pause creates this awkwardness?!"""
text16121;"""So, the next rehearsal is on Wednesday? There isn't much time left."""
text16122;"""Scared already?"""
text16123;"""She finally smirked, and I felt better — this Ellie was much easier to talk to than the dreamily wistful one."""
text16124;"""Objectively, I have a long way to go to reach your level, you should realize that!"""
text16125;"""There was a time I couldn't play either…"""
text16126;"""Yeah? And then you learned in three days?"""
text16127;"""I guess I didn't. One point to you."""
text16128;"""This isn't a competition…"""
text16129;"""Why not? If you want to be good at something, it's always useful to have a benchmark."""
text16130;"""I've personally seen your bassist play, and I can safely say I wont get to his level any time soon!"""
text16131;"""Maybe."""
text16132;"""You aren't even going to argue with me?"""
text16133;"""Yamada left for Kyoto — what's the point in arguing now?"""
text16134;"""It's like you… Well, I don't want to be rude… But you're not upset about it at all."""
text16135;"""He wasn't playing with us for long, we hadn't had enough time to get to know each other."""
text16136;"""Will you tell me about it?"""
text16137;"""Ellie sighed and stopped."""
text16138;"""Around half a year ago, our former bass player was invited to play in a more <i>serious</i> band. He apologized a lot, but in the end…<seq el_sad> You know how it happens."""
text16139;"""We hung notices about looking for a new one in clubs, and Yamada showed up almost right away. That's it. Were you hoping for a more involved story?"""
text16140;"""You clearly have bad luck with bassists."""
text16141;"""Or they have bad luck with me."""
text16142;"""Well, I clearly don't."""
text16143;"""She looked at me with surprise, and blushed."""
text16144;"""Do you say that to every girl?"""
text16145;"""Only the ones I like."""
text16146;"""I replied automatically."""
text16147;"""The words themselves weren't a big deal — I would've said the same to Catherine, or Himitsu, or even any other girl."""
text16148;"""But Ellie…"""
text16149;"""There were a whole lot of reasons why I shouldn't have said that."""
text16150;"""At the very least, she was the granddaughter of someone nobody wanted to get on the bad side of (and that was exactly what I was doing)."""
text16151;"""Sorry if I…"""
text16152;"""No, it's okay."""
text16153;"""No, seriously, I didn't want to…"""
text16154;"""So, you don't like me?"""
text16155;"""I do, of course, but I didn't mean it that way…"""
text16156;"""How did you mean it then?"""
text16157;"""I looked around just to avoid meeting her eyes."""
text16158;"""Where are we even going?"""
text16159;"""I don't know about you, but I'm going home."""
text16160;"""Just like this, on foot?"""
text16161;"""They'll pick me up at the station."""
text16162;"""Ahh, then I'll see you to it."""
text16163;"""The awkward conversation died by itself."""
text16164;"""I still feel like you're uncomfortable around me."""
text16165;"""Ellie said when we reached the station."""
text16166;"""I understand it's because of my grandfather, but still…"""
text16167;"""Of course, she was right, but I felt there was something else."""
text16168;"""If Kobayashi Jun's granddaughter wasn't so attractive…"""
text16169;"""If she didn't play guitar…"""
text16170;"""If she wasn't Ellie...?"""
text16171;"""Come on! I'm here, we've just spent the entire day rehearsing ourselves bloody! Everything's okay!"""
text16172;"""I don't think so. But I hope it <i>will</i> be okay in time."""
text16173;"""I have to go now. Bye."""
text16174;"""She smiled me a farewell."""
text16175;"""<i>Will be okay</i>…"""
text16176;"""I was grumbling on my way home."""
text16177;"""Easy for her to say — she'll totally <i>be okay</i>."""
text16178;"""It felt like I was being hit by aftershocks."""
text16179;"""It happens sometimes that you jump head-first into a dangerous adventure without giving it much thought, everything goes relatively fine, and only after do you truly realize how risky it was."""
text16180;"""Unfortunately in my case, this was just the beginning…"""
text16181;"""If Kobayashi Jun's agents were still watching the studio (and they were — there was no reason to think otherwise), they must've already reported to their master that I hadn't heeded his warning."""
text16182;"""I could only wait to see how he'd react and hope he'd be at least be a little bit considerate of his granddaughter's feelings."""
text16183;"""But strangely, I was less bothered by it than you'd think I would be."""
text16184;"""Kobayashi Jun's office on the hundred-and-somethingth floor seemed to be so unreachably far away, while Ellie was close and beckoning."""
text16185;"""Supposedly a person perceives their future self the same way they perceive strangers."""
text16186;"""So when I was thinking about what might or might not happen in the future, I was practically imagining someone else."""
text16187;"""But Ellie… <w>She was here, right next to me, we'd see each other tomorrow at school."""
text16188;"""On the other hand, this daredevil thinking probably wouldn't do me any good."""
text16189;"""Although \""good\"" and \""bad\"" are relative concepts; would it be better to keep wallowing in self-pity and mooning over Catherine?"""
text16190;"""Thinking of Catherine suddenly made my heart miss a beat, and I again felt that desire to talk to her and make something clear. <w>I just wasn't sure what that \""something\"" was."""
text16191;"""My house finally appeared from behind a corner and I sighed with relief — like I was returning from a long journey."""
text16192;"""I wished I could just lie down, rest, and sleep…"""
text16193;"""But sitting on my porch and counting the stars was Kagome."""
text16194;"""Yes, she did promise yesterday that she'd find me herself, but again — yesterday's me found today's me a complete stranger."""
text16195;"""Been waiting long?"""
text16196;"""You weren't in a hurry."""
text16197;"""If you had warned me in advance, we could've agreed on the time and you wouldn't have had to wait!"""
text16198;"""No worries. I've got a day off today."""
text16199;"""Everybody does — it's Sunday."""
text16200;"""That's the busiest day for restaurants."""
text16201;"""Right, I forgot you help at the restaurant too."""
text16202;"""Kagome smirked and stood up."""
text16203;"""Now where have you been then?"""
text16204;"""Does it matter?"""
text16205;"""Must've been hanging out with Kobayashi."""
text16206;"""It was you who wanted me to spend more time with her."""
text16207;"""Are you going to invite me in?"""
text16208;"""For some reason, she was acting more confident than usual. <w>Or rather, more brazen!"""
text16209;"""After spending the whole day in Ellie's company, the contrast made me feel nothing but irritation."""
text16210;"""Well, since standing around on the street is the only other option…"""
text16211;"""Kagome walked inside like it was her house, took off her shoes, and, paying no attention to me, proceeded to the kitchen."""
text16212;"""Please, make yourself at home, what's mine is yours…"""
text16213;"""I grumbled."""
text16214;"""In the kitchen, she opened the fridge, still looking like she owned the place, and spent some time checking its contents."""
text16215;"""Do have yourself a second butter sandwich, I'm not counting."""
text16216;"""What was that?"""
text16217;"""Nothing."""
text16218;"""As someone who works in food service, I feel genuinely sorry for you."""
text16219;"""What did you want to talk about?"""
text16220;"""I asked, not hiding my irritation."""
text16221;"""If it's about your father, don't worry — I remember and intend to keep my promise to help!"""
text16222;"""As if you wouldn't! But that's not why I'm here."""
text16223;"""Then why?"""
text16224;"""I wanted to thank you."""
text16225;"""Now that's unexpected!"""
text16226;"""I dramatically flung my arms up in the air."""
text16227;"""To what do I owe such an honor?"""
text16228;"""If you hadn't provoked that conflict, my problem probably would've never been resolved."""
text16229;"""That conflict? Are you talking about Kawashima and Asakura?"""
text16230;"""Yes."""
text16231;"""What about them?"""
text16232;"""Everything's fine now. I handled it."""
text16233;"""You handled it? How?"""
text16234;"""Does it matter?"""
text16235;"""Just curious. You came just to tell me that? Without any details? If that's all, a phone call would do."""
text16236;"""Isn't it nicer to receive gratitude personally?"""
text16237;"""From someone else, maybe."""
text16238;"""Ah, so am I not good enough for you?!"""
text16239;"""Finally Kagome was her indignant self again."""
text16240;"""I didn't say that. But for some reason, it feels like there's a catch here."""
text16241;"""You're not telling me where you were today — so why should I?"""
text16242;"""She frowned and turned away."""
text16243;"""Well, maybe because it's not me who came to your place and started interrogating you about your day."""
text16244;"""I see, it was stupid to even think that you…"""
text16245;"""She suddenly went silent."""
text16246;"""That I what?"""
text16247;"""Nothing!"""
text16248;"""Kagome stomped her foot and, apparently, prepared to leave."""
text16249;"""Fine, wait! Yes, I was with Ellie! We've been… rehearsing."""
text16250;"""She immediately stopped and looked at me, puzzled."""
text16251;"""Rehearsing what?"""
text16252;"""Music. I agreed to replace the bassist in their group."""
text16253;"""For a moment, her face showed the signs of intense thought."""
text16254;"""That's good."""
text16255;"""Good?"""
text16256;"""I asked with surprise."""
text16257;"""So you're not going to complain about it?"""
text16258;"""Why would I? I was was the one who told you to become closer with Kobayashi. Can hardly be closer than playing in the same band."""
text16259;"""Just don't think I did it for you!"""
text16260;"""I really like their music and…"""
text16261;"""Oh, don't look for excuses, for God's sake! I care about the end result, not your motivation."""
text16262;"""Really now, why did I say that? <w>As if I'd done something wrong!"""
text16263;"""And it didn't even surprise you that she chose you and not someone else?"""
text16264;"""I mean, there just wasn't anyone else to ask…"""
text16265;"""I replied unsurely."""
text16266;"""You know, I don't know anything about music, but sometimes it seems like every second person in Tokyo can play the guitar."""
text16267;"""And even if they can't, they'd learn for the heir of Kobayashi Corporation."""
text16268;"""Accuse me of ulterior motives all you like, I don't care!"""
text16269;"""<i>I don't care</i>!"""
text16270;"""Kagome mocked me and laughed."""
text16271;"""Glad you're having fun."""
text16272;"""If that's it…"""
text16273;"""Are you kicking me out?"""
text16274;"""You're trying to provoke me!"""
text16275;"""Kagome seemed to be asking for a fight."""
text16276;"""The feeling that she was hiding something grew stronger."""
text16277;"""I guess I really should've just called. Or even said nothing! People like you don't deserve gratitude!"""
text16278;"""And this aggression of hers…"""
text16279;"""Sure, you couldn't ever accuse her of being excessively patient, but today she was particularly riled up."""
text16280;"""Jesus, you're a schizo! Go see a doctor!"""
text16281;"""I will! As soon as I find my father!"""
text16282;"""She barked out and left."""
text16283;"""When the door closed, I sat on the chair, thinking."""
text16284;"""So, she came to thank me? <w>She handled Kawashima and Asakura?"""
text16285;"""In the end, our conversation had concluded as usual…"""
text16286;"""I had zero idea what was going in, and the more I tried to understand, the more confused I was getting."""
text16287;"""A novel's protagonist is usually introduced to us in the first few pages, and then, as a general rule, we learn about their past."""
text16288;"""I knew some things about Catherine's childhood, could easily imagine Ellie before I'd met her, but to me Kagome had only started existing two weeks ago."""
text16289;"""Had she had any friends in primary school?"""
text16290;"""Had she ever fallen in love?"""
text16291;"""What was her favourite anime?"""
text16292;"""She was so good at distancing herself from other people that even in her own novel she was a secondary character."""
text16293;"""In the end, I gave up on this line of thought and went to learn the new songs I'd been given."""
text16294;"""The music was a good way to distract myself and clean my head."""
text16295;"""Maybe when and if I became a professional and learned to play on autopilot, I'd be able to think about something else at the same time."""
text16296;"""But for now, the bass demanded my utmost concentration."""
text16297;"""…"""
text16298;"""I finished long past midnight, completely exhausted but satisfied with myself."""

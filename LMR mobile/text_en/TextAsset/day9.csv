text26951;"""I was dreaming that Catherine and I were driving along the Great Canyon, fearlessly looking out into the abyss."""
text26952;"""I was sitting behind the wheel of the kind of open-top SUV you'd see in movie set on the savannah, with Catherine next to me in the passenger's seat."""
text26953;"""The day was unbelievably hot, I was wearing an off-white burlap shirt and a pith helmet, while Catherine had on a sky-blue dress and an enormous hat she had to constantly hold with her hand so that it wouldn't fly away with the wind."""
text26954;"""We were talking happily about something, but in the dream I couldn't tell what exactly."""
text26955;"""And then, suddenly, the SUV's wheel dropped into a pit, and there were we, flying down to the bottom of the ravine from a height of several hundred meters."""
text26956;"""If I'm not mistaken, moments like these are when people start to pray…"""
text26957;"""I woke up to find myself covered in sweat, as were my pillow and sheets."""
text26958;"""But that dream, so vivid in my first moments awake, had almost completely faded away after half an hour of a hot shower."""
text26959;"""Dammit, I haven't even been to the States!"""
text26960;"""Yesterday's conversation with Catherine left a bitter aftertaste, like a hangover hitting at the least appropriate moment."""
text26961;"""(Is there an appropriate moment for a hangover?)"""
text26962;"""Sure, I was glad that despite everything, she still cared about me and, albeit awkwardly, was trying to warn me."""
text26963;"""But I couldn't shake the feeling Catherine was doing so out of a sense of obligation more than sympathy (I wouldn't dare use the word <i>\""love\""</i> even in my thoughts) for me."""
text26964;"""You could accuse Katya of many things, but indifference and cruelty weren't among them."""
text26965;"""Sure, maybe a lot of what she did wasn't necessarily for the right reasons..."""
text26966;"""She did it more for her own image than for some actual moral principles."""
text26967;"""But it's better to do good for selfish reasons than to condone evil by indifference."""
text26968;"""And there was still the matter of my feelings for her."""
text26969;"""Of what I was feeling at <i>this exact moment</i>, after I had learnt about the note."""
text26970;"""The strangest thing was, somewhere on the edge of my conscious self, I was thinking that the note itself hadn't changed much."""
text26971;"""Something had broken inside me even before — I guess, when I saw her entering the classroom, wearing our uniform with that nonchalant expression on her face."""
text26972;"""After that, if somebody told me she was a CIA agent, I wouldn't have been too surprised."""
text26973;"""In any case, I had to <i>make a decision</i> — I couldn't just keep existing in suspension, hanging between her infinite coldness and my feeble attempts to move on."""
text26974;"""But recently I had found new, rather unexpected issues to deal with."""
text26975;"""Along with new relationships I hadn't been looking for, that have turned everything upside-down in such a short time."""
text26976;"""And God only knew what would follow!"""
text26977;"""It was still quite early — but I decided to go to school without waiting for Himitsu."""
text26978;"""Although after yesterday she could very well not be coming in the first place."""
text26979;"""…"""
text26980;"""Kagome stood at the school gate, tapping her foot impatiently."""
text26981;"""Ah, here you are!"""
text26982;"""Well, at least you're on time."""
text26983;"""How long have you been lying here in ambush?"""
text26984;"""Long enough to get bored of it."""
text26985;"""You could've waited for me in the classroom."""
text26986;"""I couldn't…"""
text26987;"""She suddenly grew embarrassed and looked down, but immediately jumped in place and grabbed me by the arm:"""
text26988;"""Let's go!"""
text26989;"""I limply followed her — there was no point in arguing or telling her how inappropriate her behavior was…"""
text26990;"""Naturally, Kagome brought me to the roof."""
text26991;"""So?"""
text26992;"""What?"""
text26993;"""Getting anywhere?"""
text26994;"""With what?"""
text26995;"""Are you starting this all over again?!"""
text26996;"""Jesus, starting what?! It's been half a day, what could've changed!?"""
text26997;"""You know, sometimes just a few minutes can be enough…"""
text26998;"""Well, something did, in fact, happen… <w>Catherine's visit, the exchange about the note."""
text26999;"""I wasn't sure whether I was supposed to tell Kagome about that."""
text27000;"""On one hand, it had nothing to do with her.."""
text27001;"""On the other…"""
text27002;"""The people threatening me because of my father's work were probably related to Kobayashi Corporation."""
text27003;"""And the Corporation's goons had kidnapped her father."""
text27004;"""In a different situation, I'd have thought that this information was just my business, and there was no need to share it with anyone else, but looking at this strange girl I somehow felt guilty about hiding the truth."""
text27005;"""You know, something did, in fact, happen…"""
text27006;"""Is that so?"""
text27007;"""Kagome brightened up and even came closer."""
text27008;"""The girl who transferred to our class recently… Catherine… Her mother is a diplomat. At least, I used to think so."""
text27009;"""Anyway, Catherine told me that I'm in danger and being watched by powerful people."""
text27010;"""The Corporation?"""
text27011;"""She doesn't know anything besides that."""
text27012;"""She must find out!"""
text27013;"""Look, not everyone is as childishly bold and straightforward as you are — some people cherish their lives!"""
text27014;"""Yeah, right."""
text27015;"""She scoffed and turned away."""
text27016;"""When it's about <i>that</i>, men lose their mind."""
text27017;"""What… Nobody was even talking… about <i>that</i>."""
text27018;"""Unexpectedly even for myself, I got embarrassed."""
text27019;"""But you're protecting her."""
text27020;"""I just don't want innocent people to be flattened by your runaway truth-seeking steamroller!"""
text27021;"""Is she that innocent?"""
text27022;"""Catherine…"""
text27023;"""I stopped mid-sentence."""
text27024;"""Had that thought really only just come to mind? <w>Why would I trust every word Katya said?"""
text27025;"""To an extent, she had more reasons to lie to me than Kagome did."""
text27026;"""She had already ditched me once without saying a word, clearly showing I'm worthless to her."""
text27027;"""And if her mother was somehow related to my parents' death, Kobayashi Corporation, and God knows what else — why couldn't she just be helping her?"""
text27028;"""I don't know…"""
text27029;"""Excellent! That's the first smart thing you've said today!"""
text27030;"""Kagome beamed."""
text27031;"""By the way, I have news too."""
text27032;"""Good news, I hope."""
text27033;"""I managed to find my father's colleague."""
text27034;"""Ichinose-san. We tried to reach him on Saturday."""
text27035;"""His name is Ichinose-san."""
text27036;"""Ichinose-san? I think I've met him… But how come you know him too?"""
text27037;"""Well, he used to work for Kobayashi Corporation too, so it makes sense. The details don't really matter now."""
text27038;"""Fine. So?"""
text27039;"""I arranged a meeting with him tonight on the waterfront. You're coming with me."""
text27040;"""Unless, of course, you have anything more urgent. Say… a date with an American?"""
text27041;"""Look, do you think I'm just playing around here?"""
text27042;"""Honestly, lately it feels like my life took a wrong turn somewhere — and that everything happening now somehow goes against <note=note81>the Akashic Records</note>."""
text27043;"""Are you surprised that I'd like to have Catherine back… To have everything back the way it was?"""
text27044;"""Doesn't seem weird at all to me."""
text27045;"""But I don't live in a vacuum and have to consider other people's feelings, even if I don't agree with them."""
text27046;"""And Kobayashi Corporation doesn't give a damn about my feelings! So, trust me, I know how to set priorities."""
text27047;"""Kagome looked me right in the eye without blinking, her face growing more and more serious as I talked."""
text27048;"""When I finally stopped and caught my breath, she kept silent for a bit longer."""
text27049;"""I hope you really mean it."""
text27050;"""Don't forget: we meet tonight! At the waterfront!"""
text27051;"""…"""
text27052;"""After she left, I long looked out at Tokyo in autumn, filled with people in grey suits, each forced to take into consideration an uncountable number of other people."""
text27053;"""Classes were going slowly, every minute lasting at least an hour, and an hour feeling like a day."""
text27054;"""Kyosuke was unusually quiet, eventually I even wanted him to bother me with his traditionally pointless talk — just to drive away the malaise."""
text27055;"""Catherine was sitting behind me — I couldn't see her, but I was confident that she was just as bored, looking out the window."""
text27056;"""By the window, meanwhile, was Kagome, carefully transcribing everything the teacher was saying, fully focused on the lesson."""
text27057;"""How come they could switch from one thing to another so quickly? <w>Whether it was idle observation or their studies."""
text27058;"""Yes, my psyche was too reactive, and I usually needed too much time to recover from any problems in life."""
text27059;"""But was such calmness normal either?"""
text27060;"""It was as if they were changing gears!"""
text27061;"""During lunch I suddenly felt I couldn't bear staying in the classroom, where everyone except me had a stable psyche…"""
text27062;"""I was pointlessly wandering around the school and came to my senses only when I found myself in front of the music room in the old wing."""
text27063;"""Instead of piercing guitar chords, I heard the pacifying sounds of a piano coming from it like gentle waves crashing on a tropical beach."""
text27064;"""I froze in the doorway, listening to it."""
text27065;"""Ellie seemed to be playing a piece of classical music — but it sounded completely alien to me."""
text27066;"""Finally, she closed the piano lid and stood up."""
text27067;"""I didn't want to interrupt you."""
text27068;"""I entered the classroom."""
text27069;"""You again! How long have you been eavesdropping?!"""
text27070;"""I haven't…"""
text27071;"""I suddenly recalled Kagome's words."""
text27072;"""She was, in fact, provoking me to <i>deepen</i> my relationship with Ellie."""
text27073;"""After yesterday's conversation with Catherine, the thought scared me even more than usual."""
text27074;"""If it was the end, if Catherine really no longer cared for me, I really would have to move on."""
text27075;"""Start new relationships, among other things."""
text27076;"""Doesn't it usually happen like that — by pure accident?"""
text27077;"""Kids, mom and I met each other when she spilled juice on me in a canteen…"""
text27078;"""Hey, school boor, you still here?"""
text27079;"""I have a name, you know! Nikolai! You can call me Nick."""
text27080;"""Okay, Nick."""
text27081;"""Hey, are you still here?"""
text27082;"""Sorry, got lost in thought…"""
text27083;"""About what?"""
text27084;"""Well…"""
text27085;"""About you!"""
text27086;"""Ellie blushed but quickly got a hold of herself."""
text27087;"""Boor!"""
text27088;"""About nothing, really."""
text27089;"""I didn't know what to say and looked away."""
text27090;"""I definitely had an easier time talking to Kagome, and it wasn't just about social status."""
text27091;"""After all, Ellie was just as much of a schoolgirl as all the others in this building."""
text27092;"""Until she graduated from university and got some high ranking position in the Corporation from her grandfather, she only <i>potentially</i> deserved special treatment."""
text27093;"""But the stereotypes that had been a part of Japanese culture for thousands of years were strong, and I couldn't help but be affected by them too."""
text27094;"""Even though to an extent I couldn't give a damn about Ellie's ancestry, now, when I was imagining there being something between us, I felt different."""
text27095;"""God damn it, Kagome!"""
text27096;"""Are you going to interrogate me again? And where's your raving friend?"""
text27097;"""Look, Ellie…"""
text27098;"""Relax, I'm joking!"""
text27099;"""She suddenly laughed and flashed a smile that would never make you suspect her to be the evil heir to a criminal empire."""
text27100;"""I've been seeing you here almost every day lately, and before I'd maybe meet the cleaning lady twice a year."""
text27101;"""I like the way you play."""
text27102;"""Do you play anything?"""
text27103;"""I used to play bass, dropped it though."""
text27104;"""Wow! Were you in a band?"""
text27105;"""Nah, just at home with self-study books…"""
text27106;"""Pity that you stopped…"""
text27107;"""Why?"""
text27108;"""We could have played together…"""
text27109;"""Ellie caught herself and her expression changed:"""
text27110;"""What am I even saying?! Go play with your hysterical girlfriend! Maybe you'll even make a decent <note=note82>manzai</note>!"""
text27111;"""Here you go again…"""
text27112;"""I sighed without a hint of anger."""
text27113;"""What?"""
text27114;"""Acting like this again."""
text27115;"""Like what?"""
text27116;"""She put her arms akimbo, which made her look like a noble madam reprimanding peasant girls."""
text27117;"""I thought you didn't like Iwamura's attitude…"""
text27118;"""That's because she's…"""
text27119;"""Suddenly, Ellie got embarrassed."""
text27120;"""What, having a sense of dignity is a crime now?!"""
text27121;"""No, unless it turns into a superiority complex."""
text27122;"""On the other hand, I had something to learn from her."""
text27123;"""Snapping and being rude to people is far from the best defensive reaction."""
text27124;"""What do you know?!"""
text27125;"""Quod erat demonstratum!"""
text27126;"""I exclaimed victoriously, snapped my fingers, stared at her, and made a silly face that I had actually seen in one of those comedy shows that only the Japanese enjoy."""
text27127;"""If you could see yourself right now!"""
text27128;"""Ellie laughed, and the tension finally subsided."""
text27129;"""By the way, we're giving a performance tonight… You seemed to like the last time, right? You can drop by."""
text27130;"""Just don't stare at me the entire time!"""
text27131;"""God, I wasn't… Anyway…"""
text27132;"""I can't make it today."""
text27133;"""Why?"""
text27134;"""She asked with surprise, and, I could've sworn, a hint of disappointment."""
text27135;"""You might find it hard to believe, but I have stuff to do too."""
text27136;"""Apart from pulling faces?"""
text27137;"""Yes, and watching TV. And horsing around."""
text27138;"""And this <i>stuff</i>… is it something you're going to be doing with that girl?"""
text27139;"""Even if it is, what of it?"""
text27140;"""I just don't want you two to plot against me and my family again."""
text27141;"""Her father is missing, you know."""
text27142;"""I parried coldly."""
text27143;"""I understand and I'm sorry about that, but…"""
text27144;"""Ellie went quiet and suddenly pouted, which for a moment made her vaguely resemble Himitsu."""
text27145;"""Actually, you know what, I don't understand, nor do I want to! I'm not Mother Theresa and I don't have to sympathize with every beggar I come across!"""
text27146;"""What…?"""
text27147;"""I was genuinely surprised by her reaction."""
text27148;"""Sure, you could say that Ellie was a bit conceited, but not arrogant like this…"""
text27149;"""Sorry, I didn't mean to…"""
text27150;"""Anyway, people go to school to study, in case you didn't know!"""
text27151;"""And she ran out of the classroom."""
text27152;"""Was she really that hurt by Kagome's words?"""
text27153;"""Yes, Iwamura was capable of making anyone fume with anger in only a minute or two, but…"""
text27154;"""People tend to most vehemently defend the things most important to them."""
text27155;"""What could a young noble lady hold important? <w>Her pride, I guess."""
text27156;"""Had Kagome really managed to fight her way into the heart of the enemy's impenetrable fortress and hit its weakest spot...?"""
text27157;"""This is all so strange…"""
text27158;"""Something tells me that the deeper it goes, the messier it gets!"""
text27159;"""I was heading towards my classroom with the firm intention to get to the end of the day without any trouble…"""
text27160;"""However, there was an unfamiliar girl waiting for me at the entrance, impatiently coiling a lock of hair around her finger."""
text27161;"""Anokhin?"""
text27162;"""Who's asking...?"""
text27163;"""It immediately became clear to me that the conversation wouldn't go anywhere good."""
text27164;"""We need to talk, let's find a place."""
text27165;"""The bell's about to ring."""
text27166;"""You a nerd?"""
text27167;"""She scoffed contemptuously, looking me up and down."""
text27168;"""What do you want to talk about? And who are you in the first place?"""
text27169;"""My name is Kawashima, I'm Ellie-chan's friend."""
text27170;"""Chan…?"""
text27171;"""Well, let's go then…"""
text27172;"""The girl took me around the corner."""
text27173;"""She looked pretty normal by local standards — quite cute and well-kept, confident and loose, maybe even a bit defiant."""
text27174;"""I hope you realize that you aren't in a normal public school? And Ellie-chan isn't your normal student!"""
text27175;"""You could say that… And?"""
text27176;"""<i>I could say that</i>?!"""
text27177;"""She exclaimed and made a face like she'd stepped in something foul."""
text27178;"""I'm her friend — and I won't allow <i>trash</i> to hang out with her! And a gaijin to boot."""
text27179;"""And now there was disgust."""
text27180;"""In case you haven't noticed, Ellie doesn't exactly look like she's Japanese herself."""
text27181;"""I smirked."""
text27182;"""What? You…!"""
text27183;"""Damn, Ellie sure could choose her friends!"""
text27184;"""Do you think I'm joking here?"""
text27185;"""The girl was a head shorter than me but clearly convinced of her superiority."""
text27186;"""For a moment, I wanted to hit her with a <note=note84>kabedon</note> to see her reaction, but I stopped myself."""
text27187;"""After all, she could very well be the daughter of a yakuza boss!"""
text27188;"""Are you threatening me?"""
text27189;"""Do you want to find out?"""
text27190;"""Kawashima replied without a hint of hesitation."""
text27191;"""I couldn't say the same about myself, though."""
text27192;"""Alright, so what do you suppose I did wrong?"""
text27193;"""Like you don't know!"""
text27194;"""Let's not play the guessing game."""
text27195;"""Weren't you the one who accused Ellie-chan of <i>things</i> like… That she kidnapped a person, took them out to the forest and buried them there?!"""
text27196;"""Did she tell you that?"""
text27197;"""The situation was becoming clearer, but — honestly!— I wished I'd remained ignorant."""
text27198;"""No, damn it, I was a fly on the wall!"""
text27199;"""She's one unpleasant person."""
text27200;"""If Ellie was sometimes a little too precocious (mostly due to her upbringing), Kawashima seemed to be radiating malice."""
text27201;"""I don't know what she told you… In any case, it's none of your business!"""
text27202;"""It is — I'm her friend!"""
text27203;"""Ellie misunderstood… or mistold the story. She shouldn't have told it to anyone in the first place!"""
text27204;"""It was a private conversation! It had nothing to do with anyone else!"""
text27205;"""The angrier I got, the more stupid my excuses sounded, and the wider the grin on Kawashima's face grew."""
text27206;"""I wondered why Ellie hadn't said anything about Kagome's participation in that <i>conversation</i>."""
text27207;"""Look at him whine!"""
text27208;"""Is that all?"""
text27209;"""That's enough for the police!"""
text27210;"""The police! <w>At least it wasn't the yakuza…"""
text27211;"""Well, let's go together! You tell your version, and I'll tell mine!"""
text27212;"""We will…"""
text27213;"""She repeated, less confidently."""
text27214;"""Well, what are we waiting for? Grab Ellie and let's go!"""
text27215;"""She was about to reply with something, but then the bell rang."""
text27216;"""Fine… But I'm not done with you yet! I don't know what you're trying at, but I'm watching you!"""
text27217;"""Pfft, Columbo my ass!"""
text27218;"""I waved a hand after her and hurried to my class."""
text27219;"""…"""
text27220;"""So, what the hell was that?!"""
text27221;"""Why would she tell anyone about something like this?"""
text27222;"""It wouldn't be hard to find a reason to pick on Ellie if I wanted to, but she'd never come across as a stupid girl to me!"""
text27223;"""Or was it some sort of clever game on her part?"""
text27224;"""To get as many allies as possible and… <w>And what?"""
text27225;"""No matter your angle, it didn't look like a well thought-out or organized plan."""
text27226;"""More like an upset schoolgirl complaining to her friend about the <i>school boor</i>."""
text27227;"""Kobayashi Jun had asked me to look after Iwamura, but if we continued down this track, his own granddaughter would take both myself and Kagome right to the scaffold!"""
text27228;"""I was sure he would immediately take action if rumours would start spreading that Ellie was involved in some shady stuff…"""
text27229;"""Having passed through just one set of hands (well, ears), the disappearance of Kagome's father had transformed from a kidnapping by the Corporation to a murder in the woods by a schoolgirl!"""
text27230;"""If Kawashima were to tell someone else, new details would crop up…"""
text27231;"""Damn it! <w>I couldn't let it happen!"""
text27232;"""And the worst thing was that Ellie, apparently, didn't realize how serious the situation was!"""
text27233;"""Just like a little child leaving keys in a car and closing all the doors, impressed with her own genius — no one could get inside now!"""
text27234;"""Except that now the adults would have to deal with it!"""
text27235;"""I had to talk to her the moment I could!"""
text27236;"""The lesson had ended and I was about to start looking for Ellie when Kyosuke stopped me."""
text27237;"""Nick, do you have a minute?"""
text27238;"""No!"""
text27239;"""I replied harshly."""
text27240;"""Michael and I need to talk to you."""
text27241;"""Michael?"""
text27242;"""Our American friend was indeed hiding behind Kyosuke's massive body."""
text27243;"""Nick?"""
text27244;"""He gave me a questioning look."""
text27245;"""You can never tell what's on Michael's mind!"""
text27246;"""Could be tomorrow's test, could be secret reports on American military bases at Okinawa."""
text27247;"""They surrounded my desk, Kyosuke grabbing a chair and sitting next to me while Michael kept standing, <seq mi_legs2>just leaning forward a bit."""
text27248;"""It was becoming clear that the conversation was meant to be private."""
text27249;"""Guys, I really gotta go…"""
text27250;"""I pleaded."""
text27251;"""Go where?"""
text27252;"""We won't keep you for long."""
text27253;"""Break's only ten minutes!"""
text27254;"""Fine, Ellie had already made a mess — another hour wasn't going to change anything."""
text27255;"""I sighed and closed my eyes for a moment."""
text27256;"""Okay, what is this about?"""
text27257;"""We've noticed recently that you have — how should I phrase this — become close with one of our classmates..."""
text27258;"""Kyosuke was stumbling over his words, so Michael took the floor:"""
text27259;"""We're talking about Iwamura-san."""
text27260;"""Kagome? What does she have to do with anything?"""
text27261;"""See, she's already <i>Kagome</i>…"""
text27262;"""Kyosuke, you know perfectly well I've never understood the local obsession with formalities."""
text27263;"""I guarantee that Kagome doesn't respect you all any more than anyone else in the school."""
text27264;"""On the other hand, it's surprising you noticed her existence in the first place!"""
text27265;"""That's exactly the problem Nick."""
text27266;"""What do you mean?"""
text27267;"""It seems that recently you've started paying too much attention to Iwamura-san."""
text27268;"""And the attention seems to be mutual."""
text27269;"""What are you two getting at?"""
text27270;"""I knew full well what they were getting at, but didn't want to admit it even to myself."""
text27271;"""We have nothing against it, don't get us wrong!"""
text27272;"""Kyosuke waved his hands, drawing questioning looks from our classmates."""
text27273;"""He continued in a half-whisper:"""
text27274;"""We realize that the heart is a wild thing…"""
text27275;"""What?! You… There's nothing between us!"""
text27276;"""I shouted, but quickly shut myself up."""
text27277;"""Good thing Kagome wasn't in the classroom."""
text27278;"""See, I told you!"""
text27279;"""Kyosuke jabbed Michael with his elbow."""
text27280;"""He's got Himitsu-chan."""
text27281;"""Himitsu and I… we're just friends."""
text27282;"""I said with less confidence."""
text27283;"""We aren't the only ones who noticed that you've grown quite close with Iwamura-san."""
text27284;"""Even if I have, what of it?"""
text27285;"""You do know what… kind of reputation she has, right?"""
text27286;"""No, I don't. What about it?"""
text27287;"""Well, there are rumors…"""
text27288;"""Rumors, huh?! And you're the expert there — naturally!"""
text27289;"""Nick, we just want to warn you."""
text27290;"""Damn, you too! I don't mind Kyosuke — it's almost his job. But why are you getting into this?"""
text27291;"""Michael frowned, but said nothing."""
text27292;"""Nick, seriously! People are telling stories… I don't mean that you should believe all of them, but there's no smoke without fire."""
text27293;"""Alright, what are people saying about her?"""
text27294;"""I asked coldly, feeling myself starting to boil up."""
text27295;"""Why was I reacting like that? <w>Was it my desire to protect Kagome?"""
text27296;"""At that moment I t didn't even cross my mind to ask so strange a question."""
text27297;"""Kyosuke, don't."""
text27298;"""Michael carefully put a hand on his shoulder, but Kyosuke was hard to stop when he had decided that everyone around had to hear his opinion."""
text27299;"""It's no secret Iwamura-san isn't from a particularly wealthy family..."""
text27300;"""Of course, that's not a crime of itself, but people <i>say</i> she has some issues with social responsibility. If you know what I mean."""
text27301;"""And who says that? Probably the same people that bully her! And why would you believe them?"""
text27302;"""I mean, I don't, but…"""
text27303;"""That was exactly what had been happening that morning a week ago, at the school gate — bullying!"""
text27304;"""But I couldn't even imagine normal students like Kyosuke and Michael forming their opinions on Kagome just based on the rumors those bastards were spreading!"""
text27305;"""She works at a restaurant! Her grandfather's restaurant! She cooks and takes orders! And she doesn't sell her body!"""
text27306;"""How do you know?"""
text27307;"""Wouldn't you like to know! I've been there!"""
text27308;"""Michael!"""
text27309;"""I raised my pleading eyes at him."""
text27310;"""You we're the last person I expect this from."""
text27311;"""Sorry, Nick…"""
text27312;"""He looked away in shame."""
text27313;"""But Iwamura just doesn't look like the kind of girl to come from a good background."""
text27314;"""So that's how you think whores usually act? Distant and reserved?!"""
text27315;"""Fucking hell guys, I don't know what to say…"""
text27316;"""We aren't accusing her of anything. But the public opinion…"""
text27317;"""You can be sure that we're always on your side… Right, Mike?"""
text27318;"""Michael said nothing and didn't react to Kyosuke's questioning look in any way."""
text27319;"""But…"""
text27320;"""I said coldly."""
text27321;"""But what?"""
text27322;"""There was supposed to be a <i>but</i> there — you didn't finish. Please continue."""
text27323;"""My words came out threateningly quiet."""
text27324;"""It seemed like I was about to lose it."""
text27325;"""Okay, Nick, calm down. We really didn't mean to offend you… or Iwamura-san."""
text27326;"""We shouldn't have started this conversation. Sorry!"""
text27327;"""No, why? Why keep it inside? If you said nothing, would it change your opinion of her?"""
text27328;"""I replied with a theatrical mildness."""
text27329;"""Nick why is that so important for you… Why do you care so much what other people think about her?"""
text27330;"""Why…"""
text27331;"""Actually, I couldn't answer that question myself."""
text27332;"""Is having normal human morals not enough?"""
text27333;"""Of course, if that's the case…"""
text27334;"""And even if we are in a relationship, so what? What makes Kagome worse than Himitsu or Catherine? Or Ellie? Hey, Kyosuke, tell me."""
text27335;"""The lack of an inheritance or a bunch of idiots for friends? Maybe the fact that she pays no attention to other people's opinions and stupid gossip?"""
text27336;"""Nick…"""
text27337;"""He timidly tried to stop me."""
text27338;"""No, listen to me!"""
text27339;"""If I really decided to date her, would you two just mark me for death? Or start bullying me together with those assholes?"""
text27340;"""Nick, wait…"""
text27341;"""Wait for what?! Are you telling me to sit aside, close my eyes, and pretend nothing's happening?"""
text27342;"""If you are, I thought better of you! You should at least know that I believe Kagome is a good person!"""
text27343;"""And if our relationship did actually turn into something, I would be honored!"""
text27344;"""Nick!"""
text27345;"""Kyosuke grabbed me by the arm and nodded at the door."""
text27346;"""Kagome was standing in the doorway and carefully (same as all of our classmates) listening to me."""
text27347;"""That's how it is, huh…?"""
text27348;"""I muttered, not knowing what to do now."""
text27349;"""Meanwhile, Kagome just sighed and left the classroom."""
text27350;"""Are you going to run after her?"""
text27351;"""Kyosuke asked excitedly."""
text27352;"""No, why would I…? What would I tell her…?"""
text27353;"""And then the bell rang."""
text27354;"""Nick, sorry again."""
text27355;"""Michael said and returned to his desk."""
text27356;"""Kagome never came back, and I completely forgot I had wanted to talk to Ellie."""
text27357;"""Despite the awkwardness of the situation, I would have an opportunity to explain myself to her soon: that evening we were meeting with Ichinose."""
text27358;"""I didn't talk to Michael or Kyosuke until the end of the day, and neither of them were too interested in continuing the conversation."""
text27359;"""After calming down and thinking it through, I came to the conclusion that I'd probably been too harsh on my friends."""
text27360;"""Yeah, they should've thought for themselves rather than blindly following the crowd, but I doubted they did it out of malice or lack of moral principle."""
text27361;"""I slowly made my way along the hallways, heading toward the exit."""
text27362;"""There was too much information per unit of time!"""
text27363;"""The amount of consecutive interactions with people exceeded the operational capacity of my brain."""
text27364;"""It provoked a defensive reaction, and I just stopped feeling anything."""
text27365;"""Himitsu was waiting for me in the yard."""
text27366;"""Let's go home, Niko-kun?"""
text27367;"""Let's go."""
text27368;"""I replied automatically and looked at her with unseeing eyes."""
text27369;"""…"""
text27370;"""Niko-kun, how was your day?"""
text27371;"""It was fine."""
text27372;"""Mine was great! We're almost all ready for the festival."""
text27373;"""And I even tried on that maid uniform."""
text27374;"""Nice."""
text27375;"""In reality, I wasn't quite sure what she was talking about."""
text27376;"""Didn't you want to see it?"""
text27377;"""See what?"""
text27378;"""The uniform. Maid uniform."""
text27379;"""Himitsu stopped and stomped her foot."""
text27380;"""Niko-kun, you're not listening to me!"""
text27381;"""Yeah, sorry…"""
text27382;"""Something is happening to you, and you aren't telling me — fine, I've decided not to force it."""
text27383;"""But can I, at least, pretend that everything's normal?!"""
text27384;"""Yeah, sure…"""
text27385;"""<i>Sure</i> what?"""
text27386;"""I sighed and finally tried to focus on her face to figure out what Himitsu wanted from me."""
text27387;"""Sunshine, I'm really tired today, honest. I just want to go home and fall asleep."""
text27388;"""And what made you so tired?"""
text27389;"""Well…"""
text27390;"""I started, but couldn't come up with anything."""
text27391;"""At the very least, it's complicated."""
text27392;"""And you aren't going to tell me what's so complicated again, are you?"""
text27393;"""I can't. Really. You could say I signed a non-disclosure agreement."""
text27394;"""Of course, it would've been much easier to just tell her already."""
text27395;"""At least, then I wouldn't need to torturously come up with excuses, straining my already poorly functioning brain."""
text27396;"""Niko-kun, I don't want to say it… But are you lying to me?"""
text27397;"""I want to believe you, of course I do… But when you constantly keep things away from me, it's becoming more and more difficult."""
text27398;"""Do you know Kobayashi Ellie?"""
text27399;"""I suddenly got an idea."""
text27400;"""Not personally, but everyone knows her."""
text27401;"""Yeah, so, we're having an affair."""
text27402;"""Ahhhh…"""
text27403;"""Himitsu said and frowned."""
text27404;"""You should've said you sell drugs — that would've been easier to believe!"""
text27405;"""So, you think I'm not good enough for Ellie?!"""
text27406;"""Himitsu sighed heavily and kept on walking."""
text27407;"""You should've phrased the question differently: who else, besides me, could put up with all this?"""
text27408;"""Yeah, sure, sorry…"""
text27409;"""I wearily followed her."""
text27410;"""…"""
text27411;"""When we reached home, I realized that I had an awful, maddening amount of time left before the meeting with Kagome."""
text27412;"""And I had nothing to fill it with: moreover, even the thought of <i>existing</i> until the evening was making me uncomfortable."""
text27413;"""Will you come in?"""
text27414;"""I asked shyly."""
text27415;"""Not today."""
text27416;"""Why?"""
text27417;"""Why, Niko-kun? Wow! Are you really interested?"""
text27418;"""If you have nothing else to do…"""
text27419;"""Something else…?"""
text27420;"""Himitsu paused."""
text27421;"""How could I possibly have anything else to do — you're my job, hobby, duty, and cross all in one!"""
text27422;"""Sorry…"""
text27423;"""Yes, I hadn't always treated her nicely, especially these days, but why this sudden burst of dark irony?"""
text27424;"""As if it was Catherine was standing before me…"""
text27425;"""No, I can't come in today. We'll see each other tomorrow. Bye."""
text27426;"""She didn't wait for my reply and quickly crossed the street."""
text27427;"""Well, that was a conversation…"""
text27428;"""…"""
text27429;"""<i>Awkwardness</i> surrounded me on all sides…"""
text27430;"""I didn't know what to tell Kagome after that ambiguous scene she witnessed when I was arguing with the guys."""
text27431;"""I didn't know how harsh I was supposed to be with Ellie, so that she would understand what she could tell her friends and what she better keep to herself."""
text27432;"""Ellie…"""
text27433;"""I looked at the bass guitar that was patiently collecting dust next to my bed."""
text27434;"""There was a time when I wanted to put it in the wardrobe to get it out of the way, but I kept stalling, hoping I hadn't abandoned music for good."""
text27435;"""And then I got used to it and the guitar stopped bothering me at all."""
text27436;"""How do you do it again…?"""
text27437;"""I took the bass in my hands, checked the strings, and played a few notes."""
text27438;"""Not connected to an amp, the sound was dull and unexpressive, but my fingers immediately remembered the feeling."""
text27439;"""I played a simple bassline from a famous Western song and felt immediate relief."""
text27440;"""Unaccustomed to the harshness of the strings, the fingers on my right hand grew red and started to ache after only a minute."""
text27441;"""But it felt more like the pleasant tiredness you feel after finishing some hard work rather than the disabling exhaustion of slave-like labor."""
text27442;"""Why haven't I been doing this?!"""
text27443;"""I'd spent so much time in pointless contemplation inside my own head while there was an entire world waiting for me at arm's reach!"""
text27444;"""I put the bass away and felt horrified."""
text27445;"""Was Catherine alone to blame for that?"""
text27446;"""She ditched me, setting my life tumbling down this slope…"""
text27447;"""But she hadn't even been around for the last year and a half!"""
text27448;"""She hadn't been an invisible shadow trailing me, patiently sabotaging any attempts to change anything!"""
text27449;"""She hadn't been the one placing invisible barriers stopping me from performing even the most basic human functions any normal person would find effortless."""
text27450;"""Katya hadn't been putting a stone on my chest every morning, stopping me from getting up."""
text27451;"""And she definitely hadn't been the one who personally soiled my relationship with Himitsu, although she had played a certain role in it."""
text27452;"""Although in regards to Himitsu all I wanted was to keep her away from me right now!"""
text27453;"""Because she couldn't help. <w>Because I was in real danger and I didn't want to subject her to the same."""
text27454;"""Maybe in that case it'd be better to tell her the truth? <w>Or, at least, a part of it…"""
text27455;"""After all, she wasn't a child and could take care of herself."""
text27456;"""I decided that it would be better to leave that thought to steep for a while and make a decision later."""
text27457;"""Playing the bass made time fly, and then there I was, on my way to meet Kagome."""
text27458;"""I was constantly glancing over my shoulder on my way to the train station but didn't notice anybody follow me."""
text27459;"""Either they were real professionals or I wasn't being watched…"""
text27460;"""I doubted Irina would consider a midnight visit to a classmate I barely knew to be <i>normal behavior</i>, but what mattered most was that nobody would find out that we were meeting with Ichinose!"""
text27461;"""I stepped off the train a few stops before my station and made the rest of the way on foot to confuse potential pursuers as much as I could."""
text27462;"""Finally, I got to the bridge Kagome was supposed to meet me on."""
text27463;"""Isn't this convenient!"""
text27464;"""It was next to her restaurant, while I'd had to spend a good hour or even more (considering all the maneuvers I made) to get here."""
text27465;"""When I got on the bridge, Kagome was already waiting for me, but something was wrong about her."""
text27466;"""Hey?"""
text27467;"""I called out to her unsurely."""
text27468;"""She turned to me — and everything became clear."""
text27469;"""She had a huge black eye, poorly covered by her bangs."""
text27470;"""What happened?"""
text27471;"""I fell…"""
text27472;"""She responded, still trying to hide her face."""
text27473;"""On somebody's fist?"""
text27474;"""What does it matter?"""
text27475;"""It matters a lot!"""
text27476;"""I replied indignantly and tried to come closer, but Kagome immediately stepped back."""
text27477;"""I don't know what you've imagined for yourself, but there is nothing and can't be anything between us!"""
text27478;"""You'd better save that energy for Kobayashi!"""
text27479;"""I had to make a conscious effort not to shout at her."""
text27480;"""Let's put it this way… I understand that what you heard this morning could appear… unexpected, but I was speaking hypothetically!"""
text27481;"""I'm not expecting anything…"""
text27482;"""Dammit! That's not what I meant to say!"""
text27483;"""I was saved by a dark silhouette appearing out of the gloom of the night."""
text27484;"""Nikolai-kun? Kagome-chan?"""
text27485;"""Ichinose-san?"""
text27486;"""I immediately recognized my father's friend, although he seemed to have aged noticeably since the last time I saw him."""
text27487;"""Were you followed?"""
text27488;"""No."""
text27489;"""Kagome just shook her head."""
text27490;"""I didn't know you two were acquainted."""
text27491;"""Only by circumstance."""
text27492;"""The Corporation…"""
text27493;"""He said meaningfully and took out a pack of cigarettes."""
text27494;"""Ichinose looked a bit too calm, and it set me a little on edge."""
text27495;"""Sorry kids… I've only been thinking about myself."""
text27496;"""Ichinose-san, what are you talking about?"""
text27497;"""I owe a great deal to your father, Nikolai. We were friends. And to yours as well, Kagome-chan…"""
text27498;"""I knew the Corporation would come after me sooner or later, I've been preparing for it. But I wasn't the only one in danger…"""
text27499;"""Ichinose-san, it's not your fault!"""
text27500;"""I took a quick look at Kagome — she kept standing with a sour face, studying the tips of her shoes."""
text27501;"""Maybe Ichinose's apologies hadn't quite satisfied her."""
text27502;"""One way or another, we all knew the risks of being involved in the Project. I just had more luck."""
text27503;"""<i>The Project</i>? What are you talking about, Ichinose-san?"""
text27504;"""The Project is what your parents and I were working on at Kobayashi Corporation."""
text27505;"""What's the point of this… Project?"""
text27506;"""Oh, Nikolai, that's not easy to explain! Every scientist was, essentially, responsible for their own part."""
text27507;"""I was a physicist, while your father was a rocket engineer."""
text27508;"""For some reason, I'd always thought he designed bridges…"""
text27509;"""Akira-san would be able to tell you a lot more than me — he was effectively in charge of the Project."""
text27510;"""He never told me…"""
text27511;"""Kagome finally said."""
text27512;"""Sometimes, it's not worth taking work home."""
text27513;"""I still don't get it… If he was such an important person <i>there</i>, why was he just kicked out?!"""
text27514;"""They're dangerous people, Kagome-chan! The life of a single person means nothing to them. When Akira-san did everything that was required of him…"""
text27515;"""Don't say that!"""
text27516;"""She suddenly shouted."""
text27517;"""Kagome, please, not now…"""
text27518;"""She looked at me with tearful eyes, and in her gaze I could see a desperate plea for support."""
text27519;"""However, having found no understanding from me, she stared at her feet again."""
text27520;"""Ichinose-san, I have another question."""
text27521;"""Yes?"""
text27522;"""I wasn't sure whether speaking about this in Kagome's presence was a good idea, but I there was no guarantee I'd get another chance."""
text27523;"""Do you know someone by the surname Winters?"""
text27524;"""Winters, Winters…"""
text27525;"""He thought about it."""
text27526;"""Yes, I knew a woman with the name, but she's considerably older than you."""
text27527;"""And what was that… Mrs Winters doing in the Project?"""
text27528;"""The pieces of the puzzle were starting to come together into a terrible picture."""
text27529;"""No, I don't think that she had anything to do with the scientific part of the Project. She was more like an administrator. From the American side."""
text27530;"""<i>American side</i>?"""
text27531;"""You didn't think that the Project was a purely Japanese endeavor, did you?! It's something bigger than that, Nikolai! Multinational, you could say!"""
text27532;"""I didn't <i>think</i> anything, Ichinose-san! A week ago, I believed that my parents' death was an accident."""
text27533;"""Three days ago I believed that I was, at least, in control of my own life."""
text27534;"""An hour ago I was sure that my father designed bridges! Bridges, Ichinose-san, not rockets!"""
text27535;"""Nikolai, I understand it's hard for you…"""
text27536;"""<i>Hard</i>!"""
text27537;"""I smirked."""
text27538;"""But the most depressing thought was that at that moment I was concerned not so much about my parents' death, but rather the fact that Catherine's mother and, thus, Catherine herself could be involved in it!"""
text27539;"""So, that Mrs Winters… could she have anything to do with my parents' death?"""
text27540;"""It was a car accident."""
text27541;"""Ichinose remarked carefully."""
text27542;"""It's not hard to stage a car crash! Don't you agree, Ichinose-san?"""
text27543;"""I've had my suspicions… But there's been no evidence."""
text27544;"""Mrs Winters?"""
text27545;"""I persisted."""
text27546;"""No… I don't know… I don't think she has anything to do with it."""
text27547;"""But you can't say for sure?"""
text27548;"""No, I can't."""
text27549;"""He finally admitted and lit another cigarette."""
text27550;"""And what do you have to say?"""
text27551;"""I turned to Kagome."""
text27552;"""All the time we'd been talking, she stood there silently, as if trying to fade into the darkness of the Tokyo night."""
text27553;"""What can I possibly say?"""
text27554;"""I don't know! It's your father who's gone missing! My parents can't be brought back, but… Ah, whatever!"""
text27555;"""We couldn't stand here in the cold until dawn waiting for her to deign to come to her senses, so I took the initiative."""
text27556;"""Ichinose-san, do you know anything about her father? Where they might possibly be keeping him?"""
text27557;"""No, Nikolai, I can't help you with that. I'm just a scientist, and this issue requires people with greater… practical experience."""
text27558;"""But I still want to help you two! I still have some documents concerning the Project. Soon I'm going to leave Tokyo forever anyway, so they're of no use to me."""
text27559;"""And what's in those documents?"""
text27560;"""Oh, all sorts of information! I'd been taking them from work a page at a time for years, to give myself a trump card in case…"""
text27561;"""He went quiet and smiled bitterly."""
text27562;"""That's very generous of you, Ichinose-san! But how will you…"""
text27563;"""Oh, don't worry, I'll manage! Besides, I've lived long enough already — it's time to let the next generation take the stage."""
text27564;"""Thank you."""
text27565;"""I didn't know what else to say."""
text27566;"""Then I'll see you tomorrow, same place, same time."""
text27567;"""We'll be here!"""
text27568;"""Kagome-chan, I hope your father will be alright!"""
text27569;"""Kagome just nodded, her head still cast down."""
text27570;"""…"""
text27571;"""Well, happy now?!"""
text27572;"""When Ichinose-san disappeared into the night, I snapped at Iwamura."""
text27573;"""What the hell was that?!"""
text27574;"""Ichinose could be our only chance to get the information we need, and you were standing there freezing up like you're a kid at a talent show!"""
text27575;"""You managed it well enough without my help, what else do you need?"""
text27576;"""What else?! How dare you…"""
text27577;"""I actually lost my breath from anger."""
text27578;"""Seriously?! It's not like they stole <i>my</i> father!"""
text27579;"""We'll see when he hands over the documents. That's it. See you tomorrow."""
text27580;"""Suddenly, Kagome took off, walking quickly away."""
text27581;"""Fine! Go!"""
text27582;"""I shouted after her, and was left standing alone in the middle of the night in an unfamiliar district."""
text27583;"""I think there was a phone booth around here…"""
text27584;"""And indeed, half an hour later I was sitting in the back seat of a taxi as it leisurely brought me home."""

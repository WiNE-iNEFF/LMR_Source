text20560;"""Lately, the strings of my guitar had started to feel more and more pliant."""
text20561;"""A couple of weeks ago, when I first started to play again, they would dig into my fingers like sharp, thin fishing lines."""
text20562;"""But now every movement I made not only brought the right sounds out of the amplifier, but was accompanied by a pleasant response from the string."""
text20563;"""Way to go, Nick!"""
text20564;"""Mitsuyoshi praised me."""
text20565;"""So much progress in such a short time, I'm impressed!"""
text20566;"""He spoke genuinely, but for whatever reason to me it still sounded like a routine compliment."""
text20567;"""Now, with the concert just around the corner, Z FEEL-Z definitely had no time to find a new bass player."""
text20568;"""Ishida wiped the sweat from his forehead, walked to us, and smiled encouragingly."""
text20569;"""For once I'm not worried about the rhythm section."""
text20570;"""Imagine if Yamada heard you right now!"""
text20571;"""Both of them laughed, while I didn't know how to react, since I'd only seen their former bass player once, from a distance, standing in the audience hall."""
text20572;"""Guys, stop embarrassing Nick. Look, he's all red!"""
text20573;"""Ellie sneaked up from behind and lightly elbowed me in the ribs."""
text20574;"""Ouch!"""
text20575;"""I jumped in place in pretend."""
text20576;"""After that day, Ellie never offered me a \""pick me up\"" again, and seemingly wasn't taking any herself."""
text20577;"""I wasn't completely sure about that, though, so I kept a careful eye of her, noting any changes in her behavior."""
text20578;"""But I didn't notice anything in particular."""
text20579;"""Gradually, my suspicions began to fade."""
text20580;"""Let's go one more time!"""
text20581;"""El, maybe that's enough?"""
text20582;"""Ishida pleaded tiredly."""
text20583;"""If even he had run out of energy, it was definitely time to stop."""
text20584;"""Seems like someone's tired."""
text20585;"""All things in moderation! Nothing good will come out of exhausting ourselves."""
text20586;"""I was of the same opinion, even though I didn't feel that tired."""
text20587;"""Meanwhile, Ellie was beaming with energy — it seemed that if I came any closer, I'd get burned…"""
text20588;"""I think Ishida's right too."""
text20589;"""Too? Who else thinks that?"""
text20590;"""She stared me down, and I, smiling idiotically, looked toward Tokyo Rider…<w> Who had just been standing behind the synthesizer."""
text20591;"""But wasn't there now."""
text20592;"""Ellie realized she'd started losing people to attrition, pursed her lips, and put the guitar away."""
text20593;"""That's all for today. Thanks everyone!"""
text20594;"""Ishida and Mitsuyoshi exhaled in relief."""
text20595;"""Can I take the bass home? I mean, I have my own, I just don't want to switch instruments too much before the concert."""
text20596;"""Of course you can."""
text20597;"""Ellie shrugged, puzzled."""
text20598;"""I would've never been able to afford a guitar like it."""
text20599;"""So the last rehearsal before the concert is the day after tomorrow?"""
text20600;"""Yes. And we start at two — don't forget!"""
text20601;"""The сommanding tone in Ellie's voice made her sound like a general giving the last orders to his troops before the final battle."""
text20602;"""We won't. Alright then, see you."""
text20603;"""Once Ishida and Mitsuyoshi left us alone, I began to leisurely collect the cables and other devices."""
text20604;"""That's it, Nick."""
text20605;"""She sat on Mitsuyoshi's stool behind the drums and tapped out a syncopation.<w> With an expression like she was about to tell me we were breaking up."""
text20606;"""That's it?"""
text20607;"""I grew alert."""
text20608;"""You're a full-fledged member of Z FEEL-Z now! Congrats!"""
text20609;"""Ah, you meant that…"""
text20610;"""What did you think?"""
text20611;"""Nevermind. Do I get some sort of medal? A membership card, maybe?"""
text20612;"""Nothing like that…"""
text20613;"""She threw her arms aside in disappointment, hitting a cymbal."""
text20614;"""I can only offer… myself."""
text20615;"""She started to take off her clothes."""
text20616;"""By now I was used to Ellie's expressiveness and sensuality, so sex in an empty rehearsal studio didn't seem quite so unusual."""
text20617;"""…"""
text20618;"""We were walking home, hand in hand."""
text20619;"""I was carrying a case with the bass guitar on my shoulder, while Ellie had the bag with all the devices."""
text20620;"""The nights were getting longer, the starlight growing colder."""
text20621;"""But I was warmed by the simple thought that next to me walked a girl who loved me."""
text20622;"""We seemed to be floating down the streets of Tokyo, enclosed in an impenetrable bubble protecting us from the cold and darkness."""
text20623;"""The last few days had been so peaceful that I'd begun to forget the constant foreboding I had felt."""
text20624;"""I really wanted to believe that even I was meant to have some happiness."""
text20625;"""Do you believe in fate?"""
text20626;"""Fate?"""
text20627;"""Ellie thought a moment."""
text20628;"""I don't even know. If you mean that there's meaning to all our actions, yes, I do."""
text20629;"""No, I meant more like destiny."""
text20630;"""Why are you so philosophical all of a sudden?"""
text20631;"""Difficulties in life make you wonder if there's any meaning to all <i>this</i>."""
text20632;"""Yeah? Found any?"""
text20633;"""Not yet. But I'm still looking."""
text20634;"""Tell me when you do."""
text20635;"""We approached home."""
text20636;"""I no longer felt deeply awkward when Ellie called it <i>our</i> home."""
text20637;"""Except that today, Kagome was once again sitting on the porch of <i>our home</i>."""
text20638;"""Niko-san, Kobayashi-san."""
text20639;"""Once she saw us, she immediately stood up and smiled."""
text20640;"""Iwamura-san."""
text20641;"""Ellie greeted her coldly, not even looking too surprised to see her here."""
text20642;"""I just came to give Niko-san some papers for our Wednesday test."""
text20643;"""She took some papers out of her bag."""
text20644;"""I'm still our class representative, remember?"""
text20645;"""Is it that urgent?"""
text20646;"""But you weren't at school yesterday."""
text20647;"""Kagome looked genuinely surprised, like sitting at the door of a classmate's house and waiting for him on a Saturday evening was totally normal."""
text20648;"""Have you been spying on us?"""
text20649;"""Niko-san and I are in the same class."""
text20650;"""She replied confidently."""
text20651;"""Of course, Iwamura used to act weirdly even before, but she'd always been aggressive rather than showing excessive and inappropriate interest in her classmates' academic achievements."""
text20652;"""<i>Niko-san</i> and I are very grateful."""
text20653;"""Ellie said sarcastically and squeezed my hand tighter."""
text20654;"""I won't bother you two anymore. Have a nice evening!"""
text20655;"""She left the papers on the porch and passed by us with a strange smile on her face."""
text20656;"""What was that?"""
text20657;"""After holding a pretty long pause, Ellie jumped away from me, <seq el_prig>stomped her foot, and sternly looked me in the eye."""
text20658;"""Are you asking me?"""
text20659;"""She came to you! Brought <i>papers for your Wednesday test</i>!"""
text20660;"""She mocked Iwamura."""
text20661;"""I swear I know just as much about this as you do!"""
text20662;"""Ellie's jealousy was understandable and explainable, but I couldn't even imagine what Kagome really wanted."""
text20663;"""I only knew one thing — she had something on her mind."""
text20664;"""And I'm just as angry as you are!"""
text20665;"""Yeah? And what are <i>you</i> angry at?"""
text20666;"""Ellie, for God's sake! We spend almost twenty four hours a day together. When would I… ?"""
text20667;"""She thought about it."""
text20668;"""Fine, I forgive you this time."""
text20669;"""But I'll be watching you!"""
text20670;"""We entered our home accompanied by the cold whisper of the stars, leaving Ellie's guards to freeze in the car around the corner."""

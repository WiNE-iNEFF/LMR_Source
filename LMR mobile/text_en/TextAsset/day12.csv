text24811;"""I woke up early in the morning, still tired and sleepy, but quickly realized I wouldn't be able to fall asleep again."""
text24812;"""It was getting worse and worse by the day…"""
text24813;"""But while I couldn't do a single thing to Kobayashi Corporation, I could at least handle a gang of rowdy teenagers!"""
text24814;"""At least, I could try…"""
text24815;"""Long before class started, I was standing at the school gate, waiting for Asakura and Kawashima."""
text24816;"""Why them?"""
text24817;"""I was absolutely sure that the others lacked the brains to come up with anything like that themselves, and there was no point dealing with pawns."""
text24818;"""A car brought Asakura to school pretty early — there was a good hour left before classes started."""
text24819;"""I had to hide behind the fence in order to avoid the driver's attention."""
text24820;"""When the car drove away, I approached Asakura."""
text24821;"""We need to talk about yesterday!"""
text24822;"""You can't just jump at people like that!"""
text24823;"""She immediately responded with indignation."""
text24824;"""Yes, about that, too."""
text24825;"""I don't know what you're talking about."""
text24826;"""The girl scoffed and turned away, not even pretending to be surprised."""
text24827;"""I'm talking about you breaking my window yesterday and smearing my door with paint! I spent half the night cleaning it."""
text24828;"""What made you think it's us?"""
text24829;"""Asakura asked defiantly."""
text24830;"""I've got cameras in the yard!"""
text24831;"""C-cameras...?"""
text24832;"""That scared her."""
text24833;"""Yes, cameras."""
text24834;"""Anyway, I know nothing about this, I have to go!"""
text24835;"""I grabbed her by the arm."""
text24836;"""Oh no, you're not going anywhere! We're going to stand here together and wait for the others!"""
text24837;"""Maybe my threat worked or maybe she fell for the bluff about the cameras — either way, Asakura stopped resisting."""
text24838;"""…"""
text24839;"""Ten minutes later, Kawashima appeared."""
text24840;"""Good morning! We've been waiting for you!"""
text24841;"""I greeted her in an artificially friendly voice."""
text24842;"""What's going on here?"""
text24843;"""He's crazy! He's accusing us of some nonsense! I have no idea who wrote what on his door!"""
text24844;"""I never said there was something <i>written</i> on it."""
text24845;"""Oh…"""
text24846;"""She got even more flustered."""
text24847;"""Anyway, that's exactly the case!"""
text24848;"""I continued."""
text24849;"""Your stunt yesterday was caught on camera!"""
text24850;"""Camera?"""
text24851;"""Kawashima smirked maliciously."""
text24852;"""It seemed like she wasn't as gullible as her friend."""
text24853;"""And where can we see the tape?"""
text24854;"""We'll watch it together at the police station!"""
text24855;"""Wonderful, we'll be looking forward to a subpoena!"""
text24856;"""Miku, let's go! There's no point listening to this imbecile!"""
text24857;"""She said to Asakura, and I realized that holding two girls in place would be at least twice as difficult."""
text24858;"""But I was saved by Ellie, who happened to come to school just on time!"""
text24859;"""Miku, Mari...?"""
text24860;"""I turned around, and, before they had a chance ran away, blurted out:"""
text24861;"""Everyone's finally here! We've just been waiting for you! I thought you'd be interested to know what your friends do on weeknights."""
text24862;"""Ellie threw a questioning look, first at me then at the girls."""
text24863;"""They painted my door yesterday and broke a window!"""
text24864;"""Is that true?"""
text24865;"""Of course not! Don't listen to him!"""
text24866;"""I have evidence!"""
text24867;"""Yeah, camera recordings, we heard that already!"""
text24868;"""She smirked."""
text24869;"""To be honest, I had kind of lost confidence in that trick."""
text24870;"""What camera?"""
text24871;"""Still, Ellie was surprised."""
text24872;"""The cameras that record everything happening in my yard."""
text24873;"""I've already told you — we'll be waiting for a call from the police! Until then…"""
text24874;"""Okay, so what were you doing yesterday night?"""
text24875;"""Why the hell would I tell you?!"""
text24876;"""She flared up — a guilty mind is never at ease."""
text24877;"""Marie…"""
text24878;"""What, Ellie? Am I supposed to just stand and listen when I'm accused of some bullshit?"""
text24879;"""If it would've been the first time…"""
text24880;"""You can say all you want, but you can't prove anything!"""
text24881;"""I don't need to!"""
text24882;"""I looked at Ellie defiantly, letting everyone know that the only opinion that mattered here was hers."""
text24883;"""She responded by shamefully lowering her eyes."""
text24884;"""The battle seemed lost, until a player I never would have expected entered the game."""
text24885;"""Kagome."""
text24886;"""The way we were standing made it difficult for others to walk past us, but she still tried to slip by."""
text24887;"""Aha, there you are!"""
text24888;"""Kagome stopped and gave me a wary look."""
text24889;"""Are you going to keep claiming you're innocent? That you're not bullying Iwamura?"""
text24890;"""Can you make up your mind? First we're window breakers, now <i>bullies</i>…"""
text24891;"""They're all links in a chain."""
text24892;"""Come on, show them!"""
text24893;"""I turned to Kagome, but as I got closer I could see her black eye was no longer visible."""
text24894;"""Niko-san, I don't want to get involved in this…"""
text24895;"""She said quietly. <w>So quietly that I barely heard her."""
text24896;"""What're you mumbling there?! Speak up!"""
text24897;"""Asakura, having stood quietly before, entered the conversation."""
text24898;"""See, Ellie? This is what I've been talking about!"""
text24899;"""What, am I supposed to just stand and listen while this… beggar mumbles under her breath?! What if it's about me…"""
text24900;"""You think you're untouchable or something?!"""
text24901;"""Well we certainly have more rights than… You're not going to compare us to…"""
text24902;"""Miku, please be quiet!"""
text24903;"""But Marie-chan…"""
text24904;"""You can keep playing the hero, just remember that it's going to end badly for you."""
text24905;"""Is that a threat?"""
text24906;"""It's a warning."""
text24907;"""See? Listen to this!"""
text24908;"""I addressed Ellie."""
text24909;"""To be honest, guys, I don't understand what's going on."""
text24910;"""What's there to understand? Yesterday they committed a terror attack on my house…"""
text24911;"""A terror attack!"""
text24912;"""Kawashima giggled."""
text24913;"""But never mind… As I was saying, they're constantly bullying Iwamura!"""
text24914;"""Kagome kept standing motionlessly, like a statue, carefully examining the cracks in the pavement at her feet."""
text24915;"""Why aren't you saying anything?"""
text24916;"""I asked angrily."""
text24917;"""I've got nothing to say."""
text24918;"""Oh, you've got nothing to say! So, I'm the one who's supposed to protect you! Somehow you're not so shy with me!"""
text24919;"""…"""
text24920;"""You see, Ellie! She's got no problem with us!"""
text24921;"""Right?"""
text24922;"""Asakura came closer to Kagome."""
text24923;"""You've got no problems with us, right?"""
text24924;"""She asked in a challenging tone…"""
text24925;"""And immediately got a juicy slap on the face."""
text24926;"""It all happened as if in slow motion — Kawashima and Ellie froze, I didn't know how to react either."""
text24927;"""If they had been guys, I wouldn't have been so surprised."""
text24928;"""But Kagome, ready to defend herself like that…"""
text24929;"""Kagome, who stubbornly kept quiet all that time!"""
text24930;"""Ow!"""
text24931;"""Asakura said after a sizeable pause."""
text24932;"""See, Ellie! They're both crazy!"""
text24933;"""Kawashima jumped to her friend, hugged her by the shoulder, and took her as far as possible from us."""
text24934;"""Kagome lowered her head again and looked exactly like she had a minute ago."""
text24935;"""I don't know what really happened, but after that — you can solve your problems yourself!"""
text24936;"""Ellie said and ran after her friends."""
text24937;"""What the hell was that?!"""
text24938;"""You wanted me to stand up for myself — and I did!"""
text24939;"""She replied roughly and headed for the school."""
text24940;"""At first, I wanted to run after her, grab her by the arm, stop and shout at her…"""
text24941;"""But then I realized it was pointless."""
text24942;"""In the end, I was the one who'd created this volatile mixture, provoked this conflict."""
text24943;"""It was strange, even, that it only ended with a slap and not murder."""
text24944;"""I followed Kagome with my eyes, waited for her to go inside and change her shoes, and only then walked to the school building."""
text24945;"""However, Ellie was waiting for me there, hiding behind a locker."""
text24946;"""I stopped, and she just shook her head admonishingly."""
text24947;"""Is Asakura alright?"""
text24948;"""She'll live. For now…"""
text24949;"""I didn't mean that it was that serious."""
text24950;"""First a slap — then what?"""
text24951;"""Don't exaggerate! Besides, Kagome had her reasons!"""
text24952;"""To be honest, I didn't completely believe that myself."""
text24953;"""Sure, I could cut her some slack for being bullied up to that point, but doing something like that in public would only make things worse!"""
text24954;"""An outside observer, even knowing the truth, would probably think: sure, those girls were in the wrong, but just look at her!"""
text24955;"""Often the handsome criminal earns more sympathy than his ugly victim..."""
text24956;"""Fine, I'm not justifying her actions! That's obviously no way to behave…"""
text24957;"""But her stunt is no reason to ignore what is happening!"""
text24958;"""I see you're ready to forgive her. That does make one think, you know…"""
text24959;"""Here we go again!"""
text24960;"""I rolled my eyes and sighed."""
text24961;"""I for one have no intention to talk to that lunatic anymore!"""
text24962;"""You do understand that they'll keep picking on Iwamura if we don't do anything, right?!"""
text24963;"""Also, what about the paint on my door?"""
text24964;"""Well, if you have the recording from the camera…"""
text24965;"""Ellie said somehow unsurely — I wasn't sure what was strongest in her words: the reproach, the surprise, or the irony."""
text24966;"""I don't have any cameras, why would I?!"""
text24967;"""But you have to believe me! Why would I lie?! Do I look I'd frame someone just to prove I'm right?"""
text24968;"""She gave it a moment's thought."""
text24969;"""I guess not…"""
text24970;"""But think about it: what can I do? Even if you're right… I'm not saying I believe you, but let's just assume."""
text24971;"""Even if you're right… What do you want for me? Am I supposed to turn them in to the police?"""
text24972;"""I don't know… You could… at least talk to them!"""
text24973;"""I see you're a big fan of talking yourself! Can't say the same about your Iwamura though — she prefers jumping straight into action."""
text24974;"""Jesus, why are you so fixated on her…"""
text24975;"""But it was clear that to everyone else, Kagome was something like <note=note76>the old woman from Crime and Punishment</note>."""
text24976;"""Although it was unlikely that Kawashima and her gang had asked themselves the same questions Raskolnikov did, but even from a random observer's viewpoint Iwamura evoked very little sympathy."""
text24977;"""Especially if that observer was Ellie — who hadn't had a very high opinion of Kagome even prior to that."""
text24978;"""Because you're constantly protecting her!"""
text24979;"""So what?"""
text24980;"""So…"""
text24981;"""Nothing!"""
text24982;"""She grew embarrassed first, then angry."""
text24983;"""Don't you understand?"""
text24984;"""Whatever I really thought about Kagome, Ellie expected an answer immediately."""
text24985;"""Agree with Ellie"""
text24986;"""Keep defending Kagome"""
text24987;"""What does my opinion matter? Even if I agree with you, that's not the way to treat someone! She did nothing to deserve it!"""
text24988;"""Imagine yourself in Iwamura's shoes!"""
text24989;"""You know, you can imagine being in anyone's shoes — even a starving African child's! It's all easier than living in your own."""
text24990;"""Somehow, her words got to me."""
text24991;"""Easy for you to say!"""
text24992;"""Yes. And precisely because it's easy for me to say, I'll never act like that and won't tolerate it in other people!"""
text24993;"""I'll talk to Miku. Maybe she should tell the teachers everything."""
text24994;"""I understand that neither you nor Asakura or Kawashima have ever been in Iwamura's shoes!"""
text24995;"""Not just in the material sense but every other too. I doubt anyone's ever given you a black eye!"""
text24996;"""Why are you trying to drag everyone down to the lowest common denominator?"""
text24997;"""I'm not trying to drag anyone down, Jesus!"""
text24998;"""The conversation had clearly taken a wrong turn."""
text24999;"""It seems to me that you are! I'm going to talk to Miku. Maybe we should tell the teachers everything!"""
text25000;"""You absolutely shouldn't do that!"""
text25001;"""And why is that?"""
text25002;"""Because you girls would have to do something insane for the teacher to pay attention to it and take Kagome's side!"""
text25003;"""But I was afraid to say that out loud…"""
text25004;"""Iwamura's got enough problems already…"""
text25005;"""And why should <i>we</i> solve her problems?!"""
text25006;"""Nobody's…"""
text25007;"""Nick, you seem like a reasonable person! Why do you hang around this hysterical girl?"""
text25008;"""I can only think of one explanation…"""
text25009;"""Her mouth formed into a wicked smile."""
text25010;"""I couldn't tell Ellie I suspected her grandfather's company to be behind the death of my parents or that these days I was getting regular visits from the KGB."""
text25011;"""Kagome and I were allies by necessity — and you don't have to like your allies, they just have to be helpful."""
text25012;"""I'd missed the moment when things became so serious…"""
text25013;"""A week or so ago I had arbitrarily decided to follow my unsociable class representative — and this is where it brought me."""
text25014;"""You can think whatever you want."""
text25015;"""I pretended to be offended."""
text25016;"""It's a terrible pity you're not seeing what a viper you have at your chest!"""
text25017;"""…"""
text25018;"""Sure, I didn't know Kagome that well, but Ellie didn't know her at all!"""
text25019;"""Fine, I need to go to class. I hope you'll draw the right conclusions."""
text25020;"""Same to you."""
text25021;"""I responded briefly and waited for her to go up the stairs."""
text25022;"""…"""
text25023;"""Well, the situation was unpleasant, no matter how you look at it!"""
text25024;"""As if the Corporation, the KGB, and Catherine weren't enough of a headache, now there was this!"""
text25025;"""I'd started a pointless fight with the school's elite with no chance of winning it!"""
text25026;"""Ellie was clearly right about one thing: putting yourself in someone else's shoes is a stupid idea."""
text25027;"""Just a week ago I wouldn't have even thought any of this."""
text25028;"""What changed? <w>Well, that was pretty obvious…"""
text25029;"""Sure, I needed to talk with Kagome, but what would it do?"""
text25030;"""I didn't want to repeat the same thing for the hundredth time and had no other way to persuade her."""
text25031;"""Besides, I still didn't quite know what I thought about what she'd done."""
text25032;"""Maybe in a different situation, in a world of absolute equality, I would've punched Asakura long before Kagome…"""
text25033;"""I wasn't a fan of most norms, rules, and laws, but when I ended up looking down the barrel of the gun I started seriously considering their necessity."""
text25034;"""Asakura clearly knew she was invincible within the given quasi-social institute — our school."""
text25035;"""She hadn't thought someone could fight back — especially so violently."""
text25036;"""Under different circumstances, she would've probably been much more polite, while still staying within the unspoken accepted rules of this community."""
text25037;"""Kagome, meanwhile, ended up not giving a shit about said unspoken rules…"""
text25038;"""I wondered why she hadn't pushed back earlier."""
text25039;"""In the end, I came to the conclusion that I couldn't blame Kagome despite the thoughtlessness of her actions, and that we would likely have to take care of their consequences together."""
text25040;"""When I entered the classroom, I could feel the air almost ring with tension."""
text25041;"""Asakura's desk was empty, and an exclusion zone seemed to have formed around Kagome."""
text25042;"""The girls were whispering about something, gathered together in the corner of the classroom, while the guys were behaving like normal."""
text25043;"""Not all of them, though — as soon as I sat down, Michael and Kyosuke approached me."""
text25044;"""Nick, we heard what happened at the gate…"""
text25045;"""He was speaking quietly, but everybody was trying not to look at us anyway."""
text25046;"""You have my most decisive greetings, friends!"""
text25047;"""I exclaimed loudly to demonstrate that I wasn't going to follow those stupid rules, unlike the others."""
text25048;"""Would you be quiet?!"""
text25049;"""Kyosuke hissed at me."""
text25050;"""Don't try to shut my mouth! I'm not a criminal and people have no reason to keep quiet and look away when they see me!"""
text25051;"""Criminal or not, you got yourself into a nasty situation. And it's been exaggerated beyond measure by Asakura."""
text25052;"""Michael said reasonably."""
text25053;"""I sighed and looked up to him — my friend was calm as usual."""
text25054;"""I, on the other hand, was fed up with all this injustice!"""
text25055;"""Having more acquaintances and influence, Asakura could easily present the facts in the way most convenient for her, hence distorting the truth."""
text25056;"""On the other hand, who was I to talk about <i>the truth</i>?"""
text25057;"""Our perception of events is formed by a plethora of factors and looks nothing like the static moment captured in a photograph."""
text25058;"""I just don't want to be wrongly accused!"""
text25059;"""Nobody's accusing you of anything yet."""
text25060;"""Exactly, <i>yet</i>!"""
text25061;"""Nick, we've talked about this already…"""
text25062;"""Kyosuke started apologetically."""
text25063;"""And I thought I was clear last time!"""
text25064;"""I snapped at him and turned away — I didn't want to be reprimanded for nothing again."""
text25065;"""But Nick, our silence won't change anything."""
text25066;"""Fine, so what do you think I did wrong?"""
text25067;"""How about for a start you let me tell you what really happened?!"""
text25068;"""It's like this: Asakura and co painted on my door yesterday and broke a window!"""
text25069;"""Except Asakura says you did it yourself to accuse her."""
text25070;"""Really? <w>Then she'd made a nimble preemptive strike, too!"""
text25071;"""It's always better to be the first to admit the existence of the accusation — then there's no risk of being caught off-guard later on."""
text25072;"""Why would I do that? Who do you believe?"""
text25073;"""Nick… But why would <i>they</i> do something like that? After all, Ellie-sama's friends aren't some street thugs."""
text25074;"""Yeah? What's the difference?"""
text25075;"""He didn't reply, and neither did Michael."""
text25076;"""I wasn't expecting this from you guys."""
text25077;"""We believe you, but what does it change? You keep escalating this pointless conflict. And for what?"""
text25078;"""<i>For what</i>…"""
text25079;"""I repeated, thinking it over."""
text25080;"""Of course, in the given situation I was already protecting myself from their attacks."""
text25081;"""But that wasn't how it started."""
text25082;"""If it hadn't been for Kagome, I wouldn't have had any problem with them at all."""
text25083;"""So then, I'd been protecting her and it all went from there?"""
text25084;"""But why would I? <w>Just because both of us had issues with Kobayashi Corporation?"""
text25085;"""You can't win anyway. You do realize an accusation without evidence is about as much of an offense as what you say they've done, right?"""
text25086;"""And if you can't prove that they really did it…"""
text25087;"""Oh come on! Everyone knows nobody would try to accuse them without a reason!"""
text25088;"""Are you sure about that?"""
text25089;"""In all honesty, I wasn't sure about anything at this point."""
text25090;"""It had always seemed to me that there was some sort of higher justice that doesn't have to be constantly proven to people."""
text25091;"""Maybe it did exist in the USSR, or maybe I just felt like that because I had been a child there."""
text25092;"""But the older I got, the more convinced I was getting that, in the end, those with the most rights end up as those in the right..."""
text25093;"""Okay, and what do you think I should do? Keep quiet and sit still, hoping I'll get lucky and won't get hurt?"""
text25094;"""Depends on what you want."""
text25095;"""And what do I want?"""
text25096;"""Michael stared at me unblinkingly but said nothing."""
text25097;"""If Iwamura-san is really that important to you…"""
text25098;"""Why do I need a personal interest to stand for justice?!"""
text25099;"""I exclaimed, but nobody even looked in my direction."""
text25100;"""Because we're not in an anime or manga."""
text25101;"""You're the last person I want to hear something like that from!"""
text25102;"""But if even Kyosuke was saying that I was detached from reality, something was definitely wrong!"""
text25103;"""But he's essentially right, Nick."""
text25104;"""Right or not… Why am <i>I</i> never right?"""
text25105;"""Once again, I received no answer."""
text25106;"""Fine, so what do you suggest I do?"""
text25107;"""We're ready to support you, but only if you're confident about… what you're doing."""
text25108;"""Confident about what?"""
text25109;"""You know what I mean."""
text25110;"""Suddenly, I didn't even want to ask him again."""
text25111;"""So, are you?"""
text25112;"""How much of an effect did how Kagome was treated at school have on our joint venture?"""
text25113;"""Or was that not the only thing that I was worried about?"""
text25114;"""Say I'm sure"""
text25115;"""Exercise caution"""
text25116;"""Yes, I am! Otherwise, why would I do all that?"""
text25117;"""Who knows with you!"""
text25118;"""Kyosuke said with a good-natured smile."""
text25119;"""You're making it sound like this is an interrogation!"""
text25120;"""We just want to help you!"""
text25121;"""And stop you from making mistakes, just in case."""
text25122;"""<i>Just in case</i>? Do you think I've gone completely crazy? That I don't even know what I'm doing?"""
text25123;"""We all make mistakes when driven by emotion."""
text25124;"""Tell you what: even if I'm emotional, it doesn't change the truth! I won't let anyone smear curse words on my door!"""
text25125;"""Nobody's arguing that's wrong, but…"""
text25126;"""Michael, don't."""
text25127;"""Kyosuke put a hand on his shoulder."""
text25128;"""Fine."""
text25129;"""Michael sighed and said nothing more."""
text25130;"""Nick, you can be sure we'll support you even if the entire school is against us!"""
text25131;"""Thank you, friends!"""
text25132;"""I was genuinely moved by his words."""
text25133;"""…"""
text25134;"""Asakura returned to the classroom right before the bell rang but didn't even glance at me."""
text25135;"""Kagome was sitting with an even more absent-minded look to her than usual."""
text25136;"""Class went surprisingly peacefully, and since I didn't want to make the conflict any worse, I tried to attract as little attention as possible."""
text25137;"""After cooling down a bit, I realized that Kyosuke and Michael were right, in essence if not in the finer details."""
text25138;"""If you decide to oppose the system, at least be smart about it!"""
text25139;"""Gathering everyone involved in the school yard for a showdown in front of the entire school clearly wasn't the best decision."""
text25140;"""And now I had to deal with the consequences!"""
text25141;"""Kagome hadn't been in favor with the school's upper echelons even before that, but now things could turn into a real witch hunt against her!"""
text25142;"""At the same time, I realized that Asakura and co would need some time to recover from the shock and — more importantly — convince Ellie that they hadn't done anything wrong."""
text25143;"""At the moment, she was the judge and the jury."""
text25144;"""By retaliating right away, they would only confirm that I was right."""
text25145;"""At the very least, that meant I had some time to collect my thoughts, regroup, and think of an adequate defense for facing them next time."""
text25146;"""And there would be a next time — that I was sure of!"""
text25147;"""When class was over and the bell rang for the last time, Kagome packed her things and walked out of the classroom so quickly that I didn't even have the time to do anything."""
text25148;"""Yes, I still believed that Asakura and Kawashima wouldn't try to take revenge on the heels of this morning's scene, but better safe than sorry!"""
text25149;"""Catching Kyosuke's chiding look, I ran after Kagome."""
text25150;"""She changed her shoes pretty quickly too, not leaving me enough time even to tie my laces."""
text25151;"""I ran into the school yard and immediately heard a familiar voice:"""
text25152;"""Hey, what's the hurry?"""
text25153;"""I turned around and saw Ellie, who was standing in the same place behind a locker as this morning."""
text25154;"""Well…"""
text25155;"""I powerlessly watched as Kagome disappeared behind the school fence."""
text25156;"""Don't worry about her, everything's going to be fine. I've talked to the girls."""
text25157;"""You talked… about what?"""
text25158;"""I probably had a very silly look on my face, because Ellie suddenly smiled."""
text25159;"""You asked me yourself. Don't you remember?"""
text25160;"""Yeah, of course. I just didn't think you believed me!"""
text25161;"""Let's take a walk?"""
text25162;"""Sure."""
text25163;"""We walked out the gate and, accompanied by the shocked looks of other students, went in the direction away from the station that Kagome must have been in such a rush to get to."""
text25164;"""…"""
text25165;"""When the school was left far behind, Ellie finally stopped."""
text25166;"""Won't your bodyguards be worried?"""
text25167;"""They aren't my nannies!"""
text25168;"""She huffed, but immediately brought the serious look back to her face."""
text25169;"""It's a shame that you take me for a common stupid rich girl."""
text25170;"""I don't…"""
text25171;"""To be honest, I hadn't prepared for this conversation, so I didn't know how to react."""
text25172;"""I can play music… rock music…! Though only because my grandfather silently allows it."""
text25173;"""It's something like a game: I behave well and try not to get involved in anything too nasty, and he pretends nothing's going on."""
text25174;"""So, what do you think will happen if I break this truce?"""
text25175;"""I don't know, but what does it have to do with…"""
text25176;"""Point is, I have to keep up appearances in public."""
text25177;"""Ellie continued, as if not noticing me."""
text25178;"""I'm not the one who makes the rules, but it's not in my interest to break them."""
text25179;"""So what will happen if you tell your friends that their behavior is, let's say, inappropriate?"""
text25180;"""I asked timidly."""
text25181;"""At the very least, they won't understand me. That's for starters. And then…"""
text25182;"""Even the leader of a pride can't force lions to become vegetarians!"""
text25183;"""What a poetic metaphor…"""
text25184;"""I made a stupid remark, but she ignored me again."""
text25185;"""Of course, I'm sympathetic for you friend like any normal person would be…"""
text25186;"""And then, for a moment, Ellie returned to her usual persona of a spoiled ojou-sama:"""
text25187;"""Except not for <i>her</i> personally! For an abstract individual in her situation!"""
text25188;"""You didn't even know each other a week ago…"""
text25189;"""I was looking at her and couldn't understand who was standing before me: a normal high schooler like myself, the heir to the Kobayashi empire, the leader of a gang of teenagers, or the vocalist of a rock band."""
text25190;"""Perhaps all of them at once or someone else entirely?"""
text25191;"""There was so much unfamiliar about Ellie's life to me that I couldn't even imagine what she was thinking about or what she was feeling!"""
text25192;"""If I, Himitsu, Kagome, even Catherine were basic substances, she was a chemical compound with an incomprehensible name."""
text25193;"""The more convinced of it I became the more guilty I felt about the conclusions I'd jumped to after the incident at the swimming pool."""
text25194;"""Honestly? I'm not the one to be giving you advice here."""
text25195;"""Yes, I want to protect Iwamura, because… because I believe it's the right thing to do!"""
text25196;"""But you're the only one who knows all the circumstances of your life."""
text25197;"""I appreciate it."""
text25198;"""She gifted me with a disarming smile."""
text25199;"""But I haven't done much — only asked them not to give any reasons for new accusations for now. I don't know how long that'll last…"""
text25200;"""Suddenly, Ellie no longer looked like the confident queen of the school, but just a normal girl who was bound unfairly by the laws of social interaction, same as I was."""
text25201;"""Probably even more, much more!"""
text25202;"""At least I could allow myself to be an outcast and not give a damn about anyone or anything, but only by being an <note=note164>Elusive Joe</note> nobody wanted to catch."""
text25203;"""In my daily life, the concept of honor only existed in chivalric novels."""
text25204;"""But for a girl living in a golden cage from birth, honor was above everything."""
text25205;"""At least that's how Kobayashi Jun must've raised Ellie."""
text25206;"""That's already a lot!"""
text25207;"""But what are you two… you going to do next?"""
text25208;"""Say you intend to defend Kagome"""
text25209;"""Iwamura doesn't deserve this kind of treatment. If it's in my power to defend her, I will!"""
text25210;"""Say you haven't thought about it yet"""
text25211;"""Well, I haven't thought about that yet… I'm used to solving issues as they come."""
text25212;"""Is that so?"""
text25213;"""She frowned."""
text25214;"""Yeah, I know it sounds like a lazy answer, but I'm not the most serious person in the world either!"""
text25215;"""I tried to play it off, because I really didn't know what I was going to do next."""
text25216;"""Indeed, at the moment it was just empty babble."""
text25217;"""For now, I was only planning to talk to Kagome."""
text25218;"""Maybe your friend would be better transferring to another school."""
text25219;"""Ellie said seriously."""
text25220;"""When there's only half a year left before graduation?"""
text25221;"""Nick, don't you understand that nobody will help you fight windmills?! Not me, not anyone else!"""
text25222;"""Why <i>me</i>?"""
text25223;"""Because up until now, Iwamura had somehow been around for two and a half years without getting into trouble!"""
text25224;"""The events of the last two weeks quickly came to mind."""
text25225;"""Indeed, it seemed not to have started with Catherine's return, but the moment I stood up for Kagome at the school gate."""
text25226;"""Indeed, it seemed not to have started with Catherine's return, but the moment I saw those assholes picking on Kagome at the school gate."""
text25227;"""So it's all my fault?!"""
text25228;"""I'm not blaming you or anything, but think about it…"""
text25229;"""She lowered her eyes, as if ashamed of her own bravery, but what she said was enough to throw me off balance."""
text25230;"""I don't know how to respond to that…"""
text25231;"""Fine, don't say anything then!"""
text25232;"""She stood on her toes, whirled around, walked to me, smiled, and hooked her arm around mine."""
text25233;"""We have a rehearsal today. Would you like to watch?"""
text25234;"""Me?"""
text25235;"""Now that was seriously strange!"""
text25236;"""Are you sure that… considering the circumstances… it's appropriate?"""
text25237;"""Besides, I don't know anybody from your band!"""
text25238;"""I immediately remembered that weird keyboardist in sunglasses."""
text25239;"""Although… I guess I do."""
text25240;"""See! You aren't a complete stranger then!"""
text25241;"""In another situation I would have jumped at the opportunity to distract myself and see something new, but now, with Catherine question unresolved and the KGB, when I'd brought Kagome's problems to a boiling point..."""
text25242;"""On the other hand, people always postpone chances until later, saying now isn't the right time, that they have more important things to handle first."""
text25243;"""And that they'll get to them first thing!"""
text25244;"""If I had had a chest for missed opportunities at home, it would've been bursting by the time I turned eighteen!"""
text25245;"""If you insist…"""
text25246;"""My parents often chastised me for wanting immediate results for minimum effort."""
text25247;"""But thinking about it, isn't that attitude caused by failures inevitable in the process of maturing?"""
text25248;"""For many people, the last thing they ever achieve by applying continuous effort over a span of time is a school diploma."""
text25249;"""What follows is a job with no prospects that soon becomes another vital habit, like eating."""
text25250;"""Maybe someone among them wanted to become a pianist, before realizing they have no talent."""
text25251;"""Another one always dreamed of scoring a goal at the world championship, but was too sickly for it."""
text25252;"""Even the third person's desire to get into a technical college was never going to happen since they didn't have the ability for the hard sciences."""
text25253;"""And, after all that, you hear this pointless cliché that you didn't try hard enough!"""
text25254;"""If each got according to his needs, there wouldn't be anyone to work in factories and grow rice!"""
text25255;"""Objectively, only the rare few achieve success, while the conscientious and the diligent are at every corner!"""
text25256;"""Especially here, in Japan, with its centuries-old cult of hard work."""
text25257;"""While we were on our way to the rehearsal studio, I kept behind Ellie, staring at her back and trying to imagine her practicing the guitar, working her fingers bloody until she learned another riff."""
text25258;"""I tried — and just couldn't do it…"""
text25259;"""It was much easier to imagine Ellie playing like a virtuoso only an hour or two after picking up a guitar."""
text25260;"""I worked myself up so much I actually started feeling uncomfortable around her."""
text25261;"""You know, I actually…"""
text25262;"""Here we are!"""
text25263;"""She turned around and interrupted me merrily."""
text25264;"""…"""
text25265;"""The studio, or \""repbase\"" as it'd be called in Russian, looked very normal."""
text25266;"""I'd been to places like this once or twice in my life, and the main difference was that the equipment here was significantly more expensive than what I had used."""
text25267;"""Looks like we're early…"""
text25268;"""But that's fine! Wanna rehearse a bit?"""
text25269;"""I don't really know."""
text25270;"""I felt very uncomfortable, the sensation growing stronger every minute."""
text25271;"""Come on, while there's nobody here!"""
text25272;"""Alright…"""
text25273;"""Ellie walked to the stand with the guitars and picked out one of the basses."""
text25274;"""Here you are."""
text25275;"""I carefully examined the guitar."""
text25276;"""Are you sure?"""
text25277;"""Why? I don't think our bass player will mind."""
text25278;"""Actually, I meant its price — the guitar seemed five times more expensive than the one I had at home."""
text25279;"""Well, if you say so."""
text25280;"""…"""
text25281;"""We played the melody we'd been rehearsing the day before a few times, and, to my surprise, I noticed I was doing much better."""
text25282;"""Damn, El, you must have read our minds!"""
text25283;"""When we finished, I turned around and saw the drummer and the second guitarist standing in the doorway."""
text25284;"""Actually, it'd be more correct to call him the first one, since Ellie was playing the rhythm."""
text25285;"""Hi guys! We're…"""
text25286;"""She got a bit embarrassed."""
text25287;"""I automatically stood up and put the bass away."""
text25288;"""Not bad at all, but you need to work with a metronome more often."""
text25289;"""I'm not really…"""
text25290;"""But I still don't get it, how did you find out?"""
text25291;"""Find out what?"""
text25292;"""That Yamada's leaving the band?"""
text25293;"""Yamada is <i>what</i>?!"""
text25294;"""Wait, so you didn't know?"""
text25295;"""Of course I didn't!"""
text25296;"""Then who's he?"""
text25297;"""Both of them stared at me in surprise."""
text25298;"""We go to the same school. I just invited him to the rehearsal."""
text25299;"""I see…"""
text25300;"""The drummer and the guitarist appeared to be a couple years older than us and generally didn't look much like rock musicians."""
text25301;"""Anyway! Where are our manners? My name's Ishida, I'm aiming to become a professional musician, just a part-timer for now."""
text25302;"""He shook my hand firmly."""
text25303;"""Quite a nice guy."""
text25304;"""Mitsuyoshi. I study Arts."""
text25305;"""The drummer introduced himself briefly."""
text25306;"""Nick. I'm a high school student."""
text25307;"""I mumbled idiotically."""
text25308;"""Again, in an unfamiliar situation, my confidence disappeared without a trace."""
text25309;"""It's easy to be prepared for everything when absolutely nothing new happens in your life."""
text25310;"""Prepared only in name."""
text25311;"""Although there might've been more to it."""
text25312;"""So what happened to Yamada?"""
text25313;"""Ellie asked in a formidable voice."""
text25314;"""El, don't say it like it's our fault!"""
text25315;"""I'm not blaming anybody, but we have a concert soon! An important one, you know that!"""
text25316;"""Yamada said that his parents made him move to <note=note77>Kyoto</note> with them."""
text25317;"""For how long?"""
text25318;"""Forever."""
text25319;"""But Kyoto isn't that far, he could…"""
text25320;"""How do you imagine that?"""
text25321;"""Ishida asked sadly."""
text25322;"""It's almost five hundred kilometers! He's still studying at school, too."""
text25323;"""Ellie sighed heavily and didn't reply."""
text25324;"""I mean, he could've warned us in advance."""
text25325;"""Exactly! You don't just move all of a sudden!"""
text25326;"""Yamada said he was hoping to stay here until the end."""
text25327;"""And, of course, he didn't think about us! That we also need time to find and train a new bassist!"""
text25328;"""The door opened and Z FEEL-Z's keyboardist entered the room, still in his shining glasses."""
text25329;"""Nobody was expecting me yet here I am!"""
text25330;"""Actually, everybody was expecting you — we have a rehearsal today!"""
text25331;"""An awkward silence descended upon us, but the weird guy in glasses didn't seem to be embarrassed in the slightest."""
text25332;"""Nick, meet Tokyo Rider."""
text25333;"""Tokyo… Rider...?"""
text25334;"""He asks us to call him that."""
text25335;"""Because I'm a free rider!"""
text25336;"""Actually, we know each other a little…"""
text25337;"""And I knew that our meeting wasn't just a coincidence."""
text25338;"""Whatever you say…"""
text25339;"""Alright, back to Yamada!"""
text25340;"""Ellie looked seriously upset."""
text25341;"""We can always just record his part."""
text25342;"""I'll never perform with a recording! Especially on such an important day."""
text25343;"""Then I don't know what to do…"""
text25344;"""I know someone in a university band. Well, they play funk actually and I wouldn't say that…"""
text25345;"""What's wrong with him?"""
text25346;"""Tokyo Rider interrupted him and pointed at me."""
text25347;"""Eh?"""
text25348;"""The others stared at me like they'd just found Paul McCartney in their studio or something."""
text25349;"""I'm not even a bass player! I just tried it a couple of times…"""
text25350;"""And I thought you were pretty alright."""
text25351;"""You weren't even here!"""
text25352;"""I was standing behind the door."""
text25353;"""Why?!"""
text25354;"""I have nothing against him, but he doesn't know the material."""
text25355;"""Five songs."""
text25356;"""Anyone can learn five songs."""
text25357;"""Hey, wait…"""
text25358;"""We can simplify some bass parts…"""
text25359;"""Ellie said thoughtfully."""
text25360;"""If we're choosing between that and performing without bass at all…"""
text25361;"""I'm sure he can handle it!"""
text25362;"""I mean, I wouldn't want to work with someone so inexperienced in rhythm, but…"""
text25363;"""Would you wait a second!"""
text25364;"""I shouted, and Z FEEL-Z went silent."""
text25365;"""Don't you want to talk about it with me first?"""
text25366;"""Nick, we're just discussing our options."""
text25367;"""Nobody's forcing you if you don't want to!"""
text25368;"""I just can't believe this is really happening…"""
text25369;"""Catherine, Kobayashi Corporation, the KGB, Kagome, and now they were asking me to play bass for Z FEEL-Z?!"""
text25370;"""Was it all a dream?!"""
text25371;"""I forgot to even think about all of my clearly more important problems."""
text25372;"""If you hesitate less and rehearse more, it'll all be fine!"""
text25373;"""I don't really have much time to rehearse…"""
text25374;"""What're you so busy with?"""
text25375;"""Ellie asked without a shade of sarcasm."""
text25376;"""What am I busy with...?"""
text25377;"""Apparently, with staying at home and working myself up imagining one disaster after another."""
text25378;"""Guys, I need to think this through."""
text25379;"""I finally managed to say."""
text25380;"""We'll need the answer no later than Monday."""
text25381;"""But you can start learning the songs now!"""
text25382;"""He gave me a pile of crumpled music sheets."""
text25383;"""Are you aware I have no idea how to read music?"""
text25384;"""You'll figure it out!"""
text25385;"""Well, since we're all here anyway…"""
text25386;"""Ishida handed me the bass I'd been torturing five minutes ago."""
text25387;"""Even if I ended up turning down their offer, I was honored to get to play with Z FEEL-Z! <w>Even if it was only a rehearsal…"""
text25388;"""…"""
text25389;"""Playing together with Ellie turned out to be much easier!"""
text25390;"""Just a minute into it I got so nervous that I started missing the rhythm and picking the wrong frets."""
text25391;"""However, nobody scolded or criticized me, quite the opposite — everybody tried to encourage me and show me how to play the piece correctly."""
text25392;"""By the end of the rehearsal, I'd even managed to do a more or less okay (at least, in my opinion) job of playing my bit."""
text25393;"""So, how was it?"""
text25394;"""Fantastic, guys, just fantastic!"""
text25395;"""I blurted out, wiping my forehead."""
text25396;"""I think you did pretty well too, so, if you want…"""
text25397;"""I still need to think about it."""
text25398;"""Alright!"""
text25399;"""I said a warm goodbye to everyone and walked outside, leaving the musicians to collect their instruments."""
text25400;"""I couldn't get a dumb smile off of my face the entire way back home."""
text25401;"""I occasionally caught my reflection in shop windows and tried to suppress it, but the idiotic grin would reappear within a minute."""
text25402;"""The excitement wouldn't let up; there was no reason to celebrate, but my feet brought me to the familiar bar by themselves."""
text25403;"""…"""
text25404;"""When I walked out, quite tipsy, the sky above the city was decorated with a myriad of stars."""
text25405;"""A couple of beers helped me calm down and collect my thoughts — maybe I really did need a break."""
text25406;"""Yeah, this definitely wasn't a good time for music or learning how to read it!"""
text25407;"""But the tightly folded sheets with Z FEEL-Z songs sat tightly in my pocket."""
text25408;"""Whatever works!"""
text25409;"""Although I could also gain something more practical than just emotional benefit out of this situation."""
text25410;"""With disgust, I remembered Kagome's words about trying to get closer to Ellie."""
text25411;"""Was it the same disgust that I had felt the first time?"""
text25412;"""Iwamura would probably be happy to hear that I was successful at strengthening my relationship…"""
text25413;"""Ugh!"""
text25414;"""For a second, I imagined that everything in my life was finally getting back to normal."""
text25415;"""Kobayashi Corporation would release Kagome's father, Irina would return to the USSR, Catherine would go back to the US where she belongs…"""
text25416;"""Either due to the fairy tale nature of the idea or he alcohol, I disappeared into this daydream for a good ten minutes."""
text25417;"""Having forgotten about everything, I was just floating down Tokyo's streets, filling my lungs with the spicy air of freedom and security."""
text25418;"""Until a disturbing thought pierced my mind."""
text25419;"""<i>Where she belongs</i>…"""
text25420;"""Wait! <w>I was talking about Katya! <w>The girl I had sworn to love forever!"""
text25421;"""The picture of that bright future dimmed before my mind's eye."""
text25422;"""The vivid colors turned dark, the painting became covered in dirt, mould, and spider webs, then turned to ashes."""
text25423;"""Could I just do away with the feeling that had defined my existence for the past few years?"""
text25424;"""To rip apart, destroy, and throw away the love that had seemed unbreakable not so long ago?"""
text25425;"""What would take its place? <w>Or was I supposed to spend my remaining days on Earth with a hole in my heart?"""
text25426;"""I was the one who chose this life, I made a vow! <w>Not to her, but to myself…"""
text25427;"""Hot tears burst out of my eyes, but I didn't know if they carried more regret or resentment."""
text25428;"""…"""
text25429;"""The lights were on in my house."""
text25430;"""It was chilly outside — I'd managed to sober up a bit, but the treacherous lightheadedness let me know that my condition was plain for anyone to see."""
text25431;"""I didn't want Himitsu to see me like this, especially considering <i>how</i> we had left things last time."""
text25432;"""We hadn't seen each other for several days — and what had I been doing...?"""
text25433;"""Although it's not like I had much choice — what would I do, sleep outside?"""
text25434;"""I opened the door, slowly took off my shoes and, just as slowly, walked to the kitchen."""
text25435;"""I tried to control my every step — in order to not wobble or show any other signs of my <i>good mood</i>."""
text25436;"""Niko-kun?"""
text25437;"""Himitsu was sitting behind the empty kitchen table."""
text25438;"""Good afternoon… I mean, evening!"""
text25439;"""And I immediately failed."""
text25440;"""You're late."""
text25441;"""Yeah, kinda…"""
text25442;"""She cast a quick glance at me, but that was enough."""
text25443;"""Were you drinking?"""
text25444;"""Just a bit…"""
text25445;"""Why was I apologizing?!"""
text25446;"""Suddenly, I felt extremely angry with myself."""
text25447;"""Your choice."""
text25448;"""She said in a voice so calm, that it made me want to offer even more excuses."""
text25449;"""Sunshine, don't do this!"""
text25450;"""What?"""
text25451;"""You know…"""
text25452;"""I don't."""
text25453;"""Don't be so passive-aggressive?"""
text25454;"""Passive-aggressive, Niko-kun?"""
text25455;"""She smirked threateningly."""
text25456;"""And what would you call your behavior? Active-aggressive?"""
text25457;"""I'm not…"""
text25458;"""Suddenly, the alcohol seemed to have evaporated."""
text25459;"""I couldn't get enough air and leaned against a wall."""
text25460;"""Anyway, as I said, that's your choice."""
text25461;"""Sunshine…"""
text25462;"""Don't call me that."""
text25463;"""Her voice trembled."""
text25464;"""Don't call me that anymore! You don't have the right!"""
text25465;"""Himitsu, look, I just dropped by the bar to chat with the Bartender and stayed up late…"""
text25466;"""You could've just not come back at all!"""
text25467;"""But this is still my home."""
text25468;"""I smiled idiotically."""
text25469;"""What happened to the window next to the door?"""
text25470;"""She changed the topic abruptly."""
text25471;"""It broke."""
text25472;"""And the door?"""
text25473;"""What about it?"""
text25474;"""You think you cleaned it that well?"""
text25475;"""I did think that, yeah…"""
text25476;"""Niko-kun… You're sinking deeper and deeper into something dangerous every day. First it was just some conversations, now people are breaking your windows?"""
text25477;"""Those aren't the same people."""
text25478;"""Ah, so now there's multiple of them?"""
text25479;"""Himitsu flung her arms up in the air in desperation."""
text25480;"""You don't need to worry about the window and the door."""
text25481;"""What should I worry about then, Niko-kun? How would I know what to worry about and what not to if you don't tell me anything?"""
text25482;"""You don't need to worry about anything."""
text25483;"""I said very quietly."""
text25484;"""What? Speak louder, I can't hear you."""
text25485;"""You don't need to worry about anything!"""
text25486;"""I almost shouted."""
text25487;"""Don't you understand that I'm trying to protect you?! The less you know, the better!"""
text25488;"""Did you ask me if I needed any protection?"""
text25489;"""She burst into tears."""
text25490;"""You just don't get it."""
text25491;"""Yes, I don't! But I really want to!"""
text25492;"""…"""
text25493;"""I didn't know what to say."""
text25494;"""Dumping the truth, all of it, on Himitsu' shoulders right now seemed like nothing more than cowardice."""
text25495;"""She'd done enough for me to not have to live in constant fear of the coming catastrophe."""
text25496;"""Niko-kun? Are you going to say something?"""
text25497;"""…"""
text25498;"""Fine, then I better go."""
text25499;"""Good night."""
text25500;"""Was all I managed to say."""
text25501;"""…"""
text25502;"""When she left, I got a terrible headache."""
text25503;"""I poured myself a half glass of whiskey and drank it in one shot — the relief came almost immediately."""
text25504;"""After just a couple hours of euphoria, life had once again treated me to a wrench to the head, each blow more painful than the last!"""
text25505;"""It was becoming clear to me that if things were to continue like this, Himitsu would be completely lost to me. <w>Very soon, too."""
text25506;"""And most horribly, a quiet voice deep inside my mind whispered that, perhaps, it was for the better…"""
text25507;"""But only yesterday I had wanted to see her so desperately!"""
text25508;"""Having rushed back to my head, the alcohol was hiding Himitsu's scornful expression, instead pulling Ellie's smiling face out of my memory, as well as…<w> Kagome's image, which seemed completely inappropriate in this situation."""
text25509;"""My cheeks burned with shame — but it wasn't even because of Himitsu; rather, I was ashamed of myself for not giving myself a severe enough penance."""
text25510;"""Yes, I had plenty of other problems."""
text25511;"""Yes, I had to think about my own life first and foremost, a life threatened my many dangers."""
text25512;"""But what's the point of a <i>life</i> without those who love you...?"""
text25513;"""Ellie, Kagome — I knew them both for but a short moment and had no idea what would happen next."""
text25514;"""And Himitsu — there she was, nearby!<w> Living across the street…"""
text25515;"""And Catherine. <w>No, I couldn't just turn off every thought about her…"""
text25516;"""However, no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't imagine a future with Himitsu and Catherine as bright as the one I'd imagined that afternoon — without them."""
text25517;"""The bottle of whiskey was emptying at an impressive speed, the cloudy amber fog sloshing inside having successfully migrated to my head."""
text25518;"""It was becoming more and more difficult to connect the images that were chaotically appearing in my conscious mind."""
text25519;"""Finally, I closed the bottle and somehow got to bed — I couldn't just spend the entire day tomorrow under the blanket suffering from a hangover."""
text25520;"""Couldn't I? <w>Why not...?"""
text25521;"""The answer to that question could only be given by the new day."""

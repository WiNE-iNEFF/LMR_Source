text27585;"""The whistle of a kettle boiling in the kitchen woke me up."""
text27586;"""Then I heard Himitsu's voice as she hummed a song."""
text27587;"""That's how my mornings often began, and there was nothing unusual about this one!"""
text27588;"""Besides, Himitsu had said she'd be back on Monday!"""
text27589;"""Even after yesterday, I couldn't force myself to be afraid of her."""
text27590;"""I put on an old, terribly stretched out t-shirt, pulled on my street jeans, and walked into the kitchen."""
text27591;"""Niko-kun! Why'd you go to sleep in the afternoon?"""
text27592;"""I glanced at the clock — it was nearly eight in the evening."""
text27593;"""Well, your afternoon is someone's morning… Why are you back so early? I was expecting you tomorrow."""
text27594;"""Were you waiting for me?"""
text27595;"""She perked up, then realized it looked strange."""
text27596;"""Dad had some urgent business in Tokyo."""
text27597;"""Dad, huh? Urgent business?"""
text27598;"""I slowly sat behind the table and looked out into the garden."""
text27599;"""I really did need to put it in order!"""
text27600;"""On the other hand, winter was coming soon – all the unwanted plants were going to die anyway. <w>Same as the good ones, though…"""
text27601;"""Why are you so gloomy?"""
text27602;"""Not even sure. Got reasons."""
text27603;"""I avoided Himitsu's questioning look and started with the food."""
text27604;"""In the end, I found it hard to look her in the eye."""
text27605;"""Thinking about it, she'd basically been interrogating me the other day. <w>\""Promise to tell me everything, Niko-kun!\""!"""
text27606;"""I'd been looking for enemies everywhere I could, and all along my main enemy had been hiding right by my side."""
text27607;"""Despite that, I didn't want to believe that she was that good an actor."""
text27608;"""That's why you shouldn't sleep in the afternoon!"""
text27609;"""I went to bed late. Or early, at that point…"""
text27610;"""And now you're going to stay up the whole night."""
text27611;"""In reality, I didn't feel rested at all and was ready to sleep for another five or six hours."""
text27612;"""I won't! Or maybe I will…"""
text27613;"""Of course, everybody lies. <w>Especially Catherine."""
text27614;"""Why did I remember <i>her</i> at this moment?"""
text27615;"""On the other hand, Katya never explicitly told untruths — she was, however, a master of lying by omission!"""
text27616;"""And she was very good at justifying her behavior and making herself out to be right regardless of the circumstances."""
text27617;"""I wondered how Himitsu would behave in a similar situation."""
text27618;"""I went to your village yesterday."""
text27619;"""What?"""
text27620;"""She stopped cutting her vegetables immediately, knife hanging in mid-air."""
text27621;"""It was at night, you were probably asleep by then."""
text27622;"""An idiotic smile froze on her face."""
text27623;"""Niko-kun, what are you saying?"""
text27624;"""I wanted to surprise you. I realize it was inappropriate, but still."""
text27625;"""A very weird choice of words in the first place."""
text27626;"""Why <i>inappropriate</i>, instead of, say, <i>stupid</i>?"""
text27627;"""A dirty joke can be inappropriate when told at an official event."""
text27628;"""My visit, meanwhile, was unexpected, but more than <i>appropriate</i>, even if improbable."""
text27629;"""Then why didn't you drop by?"""
text27630;"""She looked genuinely surprised. <w>Specifically surprised — not frightened."""
text27631;"""Which was a good thing, for sure."""
text27632;"""Because I accidentally eavesdropped on your father talking on the phone."""
text27633;"""I deliberately paused and looked her right in the eye, but Himitsu's inscrutable face kept an expression of genuine surprise."""
text27634;"""It was nice to learn that you guys have been <i>long monitoring the Anokhin family</i>, that you <i>have been handling the mission well</i>. He said a lot of interesting stuff in general."""
text27635;"""Niko-kun…"""
text27636;"""Fortunately, she put the knife away."""
text27637;"""I'm just telling you what I heard. As for what's going on — you should be the one to explain that!"""
text27638;"""Even if my father did something like that… I don't know…"""
text27639;"""Finally, her lips trembled, and Himitsu turned away."""
text27640;"""She wasn't capable of lying, after all. <w>At least, at critical moments."""
text27641;"""I don't want… I can't believe that you're involved somehow."""
text27642;"""My words sounded calm, as if we were discussing school and not the fact that her father had been spying on my family for years."""
text27643;"""<i>Had</i> been spying on my family…<w>And was now spying on me!"""
text27644;"""So if you tell me you have nothing to do with it… I'll believe you!"""
text27645;"""But Himitsu remained silent."""
text27646;"""So it's all true?"""
text27647;"""No!"""
text27648;"""She shouted, threw herself to me and looked at me with pleading eyes."""
text27649;"""Niko-kun, I'm sorry!"""
text27650;"""It was hard to look at her, hear her crying and remain composed, pretend that it didn't bother me in the slightest."""
text27651;"""So is it \""no\"" or \""sorry\""?"""
text27652;"""I needed to know the truth."""
text27653;"""Himitsu kept crying with her head on my knees."""
text27654;"""No matter what, at that moment she was sincere."""
text27655;"""How long… how long have you <i>known</i>?"""
text27656;"""Dad told me just a few days ago…"""
text27657;"""She wiped her tears, stood up, moved a chair over and sat next to me."""
text27658;"""That in truth he works for Japanese intelligence."""
text27659;"""That he is monitoring you and used to monitor your parents."""
text27660;"""But all this…"""
text27661;"""Himitsu was about to fall to tears again, so I had to grab her by the hand — only then did she manage to calm down a bit."""
text27662;"""But he's been doing all this to protect you!"""
text27663;"""He told me that you're in danger, and no matter what, I shouldn't tell you anything!"""
text27664;"""Because that would only make things worse for everyone..."""
text27665;"""I just wanted to do what's best for us!"""
text27666;"""At least she clearly believed what she was saying — I had no doubts about that!"""
text27667;"""I wasn't going to betray you!"""
text27668;"""Hiding the truth isn't the best way to <i>not betray me</i>."""
text27669;"""Niko-kun, forgive me!"""
text27670;"""When <i>did</i> it all start?"""
text27671;"""Two or three days ago, maybe…"""
text27672;"""I'm asking about your father. Since when has he been spying on us? Since we came to Japan?"""
text27673;"""I… I don't know, but…"""
text27674;"""She paused."""
text27675;"""But what? That's not all of it?!"""
text27676;"""I flung my arms up in the air and sighed heavily — Himitsu virtually shrunk into herself."""
text27677;"""Alright, don't torment me, say it!"""
text27678;"""Well, he showed interest in our relationship before, too, and I…"""
text27679;"""She forced herself to continue:"""
text27680;"""And I… told him a lot. Nothing important though! Just some daily, minor stuff… He's my father, after all!"""
text27681;"""But you have to understand — I didn't know anything, I wasn't doing it on purpose!"""
text27682;"""Niko-kun...?"""
text27683;"""I remained silent."""
text27684;"""I just didn't know what to say or how to react to her confession."""
text27685;"""Deep inside, I probably was ready to believe her, but is remorse always sufficient for redemption, for forgiveness?"""
text27686;"""Is <i>forgiveness</i> that important, at all?"""
text27687;"""I wasn't the one to judge Himitsu for her sins, but I had to live with her somehow…"""
text27688;"""I knew one thing for sure — I couldn't push her away forever"""
text27689;"""Niko-kun, say something…"""
text27690;"""How much did you tell him?"""
text27691;"""Everything I knew."""
text27692;"""But he's only trying to help and protect you… us!"""
text27693;"""I'd like to believe that."""
text27694;"""I smirked sadly and stood up."""
text27695;"""My legs had become terribly numb for some reason, so I had to make a few rounds of the kitchen."""
text27696;"""I don't blame you for trusting him."""
text27697;"""Niko-kun…"""
text27698;"""Himitsu kept going on, which started to irritate me — at the moment I needed something constructive, not her whining!"""
text27699;"""I need to think."""
text27700;"""She looked at me with hope in her eyes but immediately realized that I was going to <i>think</i> alone."""
text27701;"""Alright, see you tomorrow then?"""
text27702;"""Yeah…"""
text27703;"""I replied absent-mindedly."""
text27704;"""…"""
text27705;"""Even my relationship with Catherine was simpler in many respects!"""
text27706;"""Because I could expect anything from her, but there were things I would never have suspected Himitsu of!"""
text27707;"""It wasn't even about whether I could forgive her…"""
text27708;"""What was important was whether I could be sure that she wouldn't pull another trick like this in the future."""
text27709;"""Besides, forgiveness and meekness are easy to get used to – and then eventually you lose your self-respect and what you thought was unacceptable before becomes quite permissible!"""
text27710;"""God, if only it was someone else in her place!"""
text27711;"""Someone I'd expect such twists from."""
text27712;"""Catherine… <w>Yes, that would be likely!"""
text27713;"""A phone call woke the house after it had just slipped into slumber."""
text27714;"""I jumped up, followed by a myriad of dust particles, as they danced in the dim light of the kitchen lamp."""
text27715;"""Hello."""
text27716;"""Hi, you're not asleep?"""
text27717;"""It's too early for that."""
text27718;"""Speak of the devil!"""
text27719;"""What do you want?"""
text27720;"""Just a second ago I'd been thinking about her, but over the past two days I'd realized the Catherine in my mind and the one I was talking to now weren't the same person!"""
text27721;"""Shall we meet?"""
text27722;"""Why would we?"""
text27723;"""Do you need a special reason?"""
text27724;"""I guess I do."""
text27725;"""Well, let's say I miss you."""
text27726;"""This is a bad time for jokes, Katya!"""
text27727;"""What if I'm not joking? How would you know?"""
text27728;"""Okay, alright… Where?"""
text27729;"""I don't care."""
text27730;"""Then…"""
text27731;"""In the park"""
text27732;"""…let's meet in the park."""
text27733;"""I just wanted to get some fresh air."""
text27734;"""In the bar."""
text27735;"""…let's meet at the bar. I'm starving."""
text27736;"""Or maybe I wanted a drink, not food — after all, I had just eaten breakfast."""
text27737;"""Okay, see you in an hour."""
text27738;"""She said, and, not waiting for my reply, hung up."""
text27739;"""Damn it, this is just wonderful…"""
text27740;"""What if I were to tell her everything: about Himitsu, her father, Ichinose...?"""
text27741;"""I really needed someone I could trust."""
text27742;"""Or I just wanted somebody to hear me out, someone to get this off my chest to."""
text27743;"""And since I wasn't sure if Himitsu could be that person…"""
text27744;"""…"""
text27745;"""On the other hand, it was clearly dangerous!"""
text27746;"""I reached the meeting point in forty minutes, and to my surprise, Catherine had come early as well."""
text27747;"""We sat on a bench."""
text27748;"""We sat behind a table."""
text27749;"""You're early today."""
text27750;"""So are you."""
text27751;"""I don't want to disappoint you, but arriving early is normal."""
text27752;"""What did you want to talk about?"""
text27753;"""I wanted to say that we should have a fresh start!"""
text27754;"""What do you mean?"""
text27755;"""I was startled and even moved away from her a bit."""
text27756;"""I was startled and even moved away from the table a bit."""
text27757;"""It may sound silly, but I've been thinking a lot, and I realized that you're right."""
text27758;"""After all, we still need to study together!"""
text27759;"""I couldn't remember myself saying anything like that! <w>At least, not wording it that way."""
text27760;"""So, you want to remain friends?"""
text27761;"""Catherine smirked."""
text27762;"""I guess we've never really been friends — our relationship <i>deepened</i> right away."""
text27763;"""But we can do everything right this time."""
text27764;"""By saying <i>\""right\""</i> you're implying it was <i>\""wrong\""</i> before?"""
text27765;"""I hope each of us can draw conclusions on that ourselves."""
text27766;"""In a sense, I happy to hear it from her. I guess."""
text27767;"""At least now I'd be able to think less about Catherine."""
text27768;"""Because I definitely had more urgent issues at hand."""
text27769;"""Even disregarding the gravity of each one of them, the situation with my parents' past and my and Himitsu's present was way more important than my feelings for Katya."""
text27770;"""Because there was a good chance that I would not have a future to sort those feelings out in."""
text27771;"""If it's fine by you…"""
text27772;"""I wouldn't make the offer otherwise. Is it…<i>fine</i> by you though?"""
text27773;"""I can live with it."""
text27774;"""Catherine gave me a piercing look, and for a second I could see a shadow of irritation cross her face."""
text27775;"""She probably wanted to figure out what I was thinking about."""
text27776;"""No wonder – I was just way too tired and couldn't be bothered with facial expressions."""
text27777;"""Well then…"""
text27778;"""She said seriously."""
text27779;"""Should we shake hands too?"""
text27780;"""Why not!"""
text27781;"""Katya reached out, and I shook her hand without hesitation."""
text27782;"""Well, we have a deal then."""
text27783;"""By the way, how's Himitsu?"""
text27784;"""Why?"""
text27785;"""I put myself on guard right away."""
text27786;"""You've become too distrustful."""
text27787;"""Why do you think that?"""
text27788;"""Because it's obvious."""
text27789;"""She threw her hands up."""
text27790;"""I have good reasons to be, don't you think?"""
text27791;"""Yeah? What reasons?"""
text27792;"""Well, I don't know!"""
text27793;"""I replied sarcastically."""
text27794;"""Some notes, for one…"""
text27795;"""We've already discussed that."""
text27796;"""Why do you all think that having a <i>discussion</i> changes anything? That words can fix actions?"""
text27797;"""Who is <i>we</i>?"""
text27798;"""Just <i>all of you</i>!"""
text27799;"""In this case, going on like that will drive you mad. You might not believe it, but I'm worried about you too…"""
text27800;"""…to some extent."""
text27801;"""Catherine specified immediately."""
text27802;"""So, my question about Himitsu is quite appropriate."""
text27803;"""She's okay. She's doing fine."""
text27804;"""I replied briefly."""
text27805;"""I wished that was the case!"""
text27806;"""You can talk to her yourself. For example, tomorrow at school. Will you be there?"""
text27807;"""I will."""
text27808;"""The conversation seemed to wither away on its own."""
text27809;"""We seemed to have signed a peace treaty but had no idea what to do now."""
text27810;"""I wanted and had an opportunity to take a break from my inner turmoil over her, but the whole conversation felt like some weird formality."""
text27811;"""Like a military dispatch about a ceasefire…"""
text27812;"""By the time the news reached all the soldiers in the trenches, a dozen would have been torn apart by shrapnel."""
text27813;"""It was Katya's turn to break the silence:"""
text27814;"""Alright then."""
text27815;"""How are you doing, by the way?"""
text27816;"""Fine."""
text27817;"""She smiled, a bit unnaturally, as it seemed to me."""
text27818;"""That's what you expected to hear, right? I really don't have much to tell though. Well, I bought a calendar and have been crossing days off with a big red marker."""
text27819;"""Days left before the end of the school year?"""
text27820;"""Exactly."""
text27821;"""Does it help?"""
text27822;"""I don't know yet."""
text27823;"""Silence descended upon us again."""
text27824;"""Well, I have to go."""
text27825;"""Yeah, see you."""
text27826;"""I said as if I were saying goodbye to Kyosuke, not her."""
text27827;"""…"""
text27828;"""It was nearing midnight."""
text27829;"""That conversation with Catherine had calmed me down a bit."""
text27830;"""Whatever Ms Winters had on her mind, I doubted she'd put her own daughter in harm's way. <i>If only by letting her communicate with me."""
text27831;"""In that regard, the Americans were still ahead of the Japanese."""
text27832;"""Since when had my life become this ridiculous baseball match with me as the ball being tossed back and forth between opposing teams?"""
text27833;"""The light was on in the windows and I immediately knew it was Himitsu — she was used to finishing what she started."""
text27834;"""And if I hadn't forgiven her earlier, I definitely had to forgive her now."""
text27835;"""That's what she thought."""
text27836;"""That's what mattered to her — threadbare forgiveness."""
text27837;"""I don't know if it's because of my upbringing or something else, but I always thought this behavior was like expecting praise from <note=note85>a shogun</note>."""
text27838;"""Or, in our case, expecting clemency."""
text27839;"""To some extent, this situation wasn't that hopeless."""
text27840;"""The death penalty couldn't resurrect a killer's victims, but a relationship can be fixed, and trust can be regained."""
text27841;"""At least, in theory."""
text27842;"""I wasn't sure I was ready for that."""
text27843;"""Niko-kun, sorry I'm here, I know you wanted to be alone."""
text27844;"""On the other hand, while I was deciding how to live from here on, I could take her keys."""
text27845;"""Although I had nothing to hide at home, except for some dusty corners, an empty fridge, and an open bottle of whiskey in the сupboard."""
text27846;"""I would be more surprised if you weren't here."""
text27847;"""Hey!"""
text27848;"""She was about to get annoyed but quickly caught herself."""
text27849;"""I told you you wouldn't be able to sleep tonight."""
text27850;"""So you…"""
text27851;"""\""won't ask me where I was?\"""""
text27852;"""No, I shouldn't provoke her anymore!"""
text27853;"""Whatever the case, I wasn't going to tell her that I'd met with Catherine, and if Himitsu didn't ask first, there was no need to bring it up."""
text27854;"""…didn't make dinner?"""
text27855;"""It's not healthy to eat at night!"""
text27856;"""It's not healthy if you're going to sleep, but you just said I won't be."""
text27857;"""But…"""
text27858;"""It seemed her logic circuits had overloaded."""
text27859;"""Alright, relax, that was a joke."""
text27860;"""I took out a new pack of tea, opened it, and put a teapot on the stove."""
text27861;"""In fact, I'm glad you came."""
text27862;"""Really?"""
text27863;"""She asked distrustfully."""
text27864;"""Now, when you've calmed down a bit, we can talk normally."""
text27865;"""You have calmed down, haven't you?"""
text27866;"""I asked and looked at Himitsu."""
text27867;"""She was sitting, fidgeting with a napkin, and seemed to avoid looking at me."""
text27868;"""What do you want to talk about?"""
text27869;"""About your father! Do I have a more important topic?"""
text27870;"""But… Niko-kun, I don't know anything except what I've already told you."""
text27871;"""I wasn't going to spy on you!"""
text27872;"""..."""
text27873;"""You need to understand that I'm a victim here too!"""
text27874;"""Her excuses were poor, and even — although it was hard to acknowledge even to myself — revolting."""
text27875;"""Of course, Himitsu wasn't a pathological liar, but now she was behaving like a little child who wouldn't admit her guilt even caught red-handed trying to take a box of cookies from the cupboard."""
text27876;"""Let's say I agree that you're <i>not guilty</i> — will you tell me what you know?"""
text27877;"""But I'm really not…"""
text27878;"""She sighed, apparently realising what I wanted from her."""
text27879;"""Think about it yourself, why would dad tell me anything else?"""
text27880;"""I don't know."""
text27881;"""More than that, I couldn't understand how he could drag his own daughter into all this!"""
text27882;"""Maybe it's more about you than your father. Why didn't you tell me everything right away?"""
text27883;"""Because he… you will… we would all be worse off…"""
text27884;"""My exhausted psyche couldn't withstand another crying fit."""
text27885;"""I quickly grabbed the mugs and put one of them in front of her."""
text27886;"""With chamomile, as you like."""
text27887;"""Thank you."""
text27888;"""Himitsu looked surprised."""
text27889;"""There was no real reason for that though — I always had a fine selection of teas."""
text27890;"""Mostly because of her, but I had also bought some myself."""
text27891;"""It's not like I did anything weird…"""
text27892;"""No, it's just… Thank you!"""
text27893;"""We were drinking tea slowly, and, probably were both happy to keep silent for a while and gather our thoughts."""
text27894;"""Naturally, I had to <i>forgive</i> her — otherwise we'd never get out of this deadlock."""
text27895;"""I was just concerned that it might give Himitsu a sense of impunity."""
text27896;"""After all, she had always been a good girl, obeyed her parents and teachers, respected her elders, was a role model for younger children, lived an almost <i>exemplary</i> life."""
text27897;"""And if it so happened that she was wrong about something, or God forbid found guilty of anything, it would always hit Himitsu hard."""
text27898;"""That was why my forgiveness was subconsciously so important to her."""
text27899;"""But to me, it was important that it didn't come too easily."""
text27900;"""Unlike Catherine."""
text27901;"""Catherine always paid too much attention to what they refer to in English as <i>\""appearance\""</i>."""
text27902;"""At the same time, she couldn't care less whether others perceived her as good or evil, right or wrong, virtuous or deeply vicious."""
text27903;"""Respect was all that mattered to her."""
text27904;"""And tyrants are respected as much as prophets."""
text27905;"""I assumed she didn't think about the reasons — be it worship, fear, or love."""
text27906;"""In a way, these two girls represented two philosophical opposites to me — idealism and materialism, altruism and egoism."""
text27907;"""Platonic love and friendship — and carnality, sexual desire, even lust."""
text27908;"""Earth… Earth to Niko-kun…"""
text27909;"""Himitsu said timidly."""
text27910;"""The tea had time to grow a little colder."""
text27911;"""I can't forgive you…"""
text27912;"""I went silent for a moment and continued right away in order to avoid a сheap theatrical pause:"""
text27913;"""Because I wasn't upset with you in the first place."""
text27914;"""Really?"""
text27915;"""She raised her huge green eyes at me, and I could see a spark of hope in them."""
text27916;"""Sure! Just put yourself in my shoes — how would you react? Of course I was surprised!"""
text27917;"""But promise that there will be no secrets between us from now on!"""
text27918;"""I promise!"""
text27919;"""Himitsu said solemnly."""
text27920;"""Well, it's pretty late already… You can tell your father that nothing unusual happened at Anokhin's place today!"""
text27921;"""I grinned good-naturedly."""
text27922;"""I definitely will!"""
text27923;"""Himitsu responded but clearly didn't intend to leave."""
text27924;"""I'm not planning to sleep, but that doesn't mean you have to sit up with me."""
text27925;"""She hesitated, but in the end, stood up."""
text27926;"""Good night, see you tomorrow!"""
text27927;"""Good night."""
text27928;"""I saw her to the door."""
text27929;"""…"""
text27930;"""I hoped that Himitsu believed I had <i>forgiven</i> her."""
text27931;"""To me, however, this was just the beginning!"""
text27932;"""Fortunately over the last couple of hours, I had managed to calm down and come up with a plan."""
text27933;"""Without unnecessary hesitation, I grabbed the receiver and dialled the number I had memorized."""
text27934;"""I didn't get a reply right away — after all, it was past midnight."""
text27935;"""Good evening. I'm sorry to bother you so late, but I need to know if Agawa-san is at home."""
text27936;"""A sleepy voice grumbled: \""You got the wrong number\"", — and I began to wait."""
text27937;"""The telephone bell pierced the silence of my house only half an hour later."""
text27938;"""Shino-san ordered a delivery to this address."""
text27939;"""Sorry, you got the wrong number"""
text27940;"""Isn't this…"""
text27941;"""He spelled my phone number with one digit off."""
text27942;"""No, it's…"""
text27943;"""My sincere apologies! Have a good night."""
text27944;"""I didn't know if petty tricks like this would work on KGB agents or Japanese intelligence, but I soon realized Ichinose would be waiting for me at that same spot on the waterfront."""
text27945;"""And I already knew how to escape the house without attracting any attention."""
text27946;"""It was time to <i>go to bed</i> then!"""
text27947;"""This time I felt calmer sneaking through the streets of my district."""
text27948;"""If Himitsu had done everything right, I had nothing to fear from Japanese intelligence."""
text27949;"""I hadn't noticed KGB agents following me even once, and I wasn't even sure if they truly were watching me. As for Kobayashi Corporation…"""
text27950;"""Who could guarantee that the Corporation and Japanese secret service weren't pursuing the same goal?"""
text27951;"""The last train had left long ago, but luckily taxis were available twenty-four hours a day — I just needed to dial an easily memorized number."""
text27952;"""The car came pretty fast, and less than an hour later I found myself on the waterfront."""
text27953;"""I could see the dim light of a cigarette in the darkness, and a familiar slumping silhouette appeared against the silver moonlight."""
text27954;"""Ichinose-san?"""
text27955;"""I called fearfully, still afraid of having made a mistake."""
text27956;"""Were you expecting someone else?"""
text27957;"""He came closer and smiled in an excessively friendly manner."""
text27958;"""You seem to be in a good mood, have you been waiting for long?"""
text27959;"""Does it matter?"""
text27960;"""I guess not…"""
text27961;"""Did something happen, Nikolai? I hope you understand that getting in contact with me over some trifling matter is risky for you in the first place?"""
text27962;"""If only it was a trifle!"""
text27963;"""I sighed."""
text27964;"""So, what's it about?"""
text27965;"""Ichinose-san, be honest with me, have you told me the whole truth?"""
text27966;"""I simply don't know the whole truth."""
text27967;"""He replied and immediately lit another cigarette."""
text27968;"""But you aren't hiding anything, right?"""
text27969;"""Perhaps at first I was worried — I definitely was! — but now anger took over."""
text27970;"""I was angry as much at this old man as I was the people forcing us to be out here now, hiding in the night like criminals!"""
text27971;"""I was angry at the people who took my parents away from me, destroyed my daily life and turned me into a God damn schizophrenic."""
text27972;"""I really want to believe that's not the case!"""
text27973;"""Tell me what's on your mind already!"""
text27974;"""Because…"""
text27975;"""My face flinched involuntarily, and tears welled up in my eyes."""
text27976;"""After all, going through this on my own and sharing my inner turmoil with another person were not one and the same."""
text27977;"""…it's hard for me to think that you knew about Japanese intelligence and hid it from me."""
text27978;"""Japanese intelligence?"""
text27979;"""He didn't look particularly surprised, but took half a step to the side."""
text27980;"""My best friend's father… the girl I've spent my whole life with! Her father works for Japanese intelligence."""
text27981;"""More importantly, he's been spying on my family since we arrived in Japan!"""
text27982;"""Nikolai, I had no idea…"""
text27983;"""I really want to believe that you didn't!"""
text27984;"""Of course, it's obvious that Japanese intelligence is well informed about the Project and has been monitoring people involved in it, but I had never thought… Nikolai, tell me more."""
text27985;"""There isn't much to tell. I happened to learn about it by accident."""
text27986;"""It's just hard to accept that a person who has been your neighbor all your life, a person who you trusted, turned out to be someone you should never trust under any circumstance."""
text27987;"""I smirked sadly."""
text27988;"""Was I really talking about Ryunosuke-san?"""
text27989;"""Frankly speaking, we never were particularly close — rather, I was afraid of him."""
text27990;"""A strict neighbor and your girl-friend's father — is a great cover, as it turns out!"""
text27991;"""What about a childhood friend? <w>Was that a good cover?"""
text27992;"""Nikolai, that is terrible, I realize, of course, but…"""
text27993;"""Ichinose glanced around as if gathering his thoughts rather than checking for any hidden threats."""
text27994;"""How much does he know? This isn't just about you, after all."""
text27995;"""Well, he definitely hasn't gotten anything from me. Only because I don't know anything myself! At least I didn't a week ago."""
text27996;"""But you do now."""
text27997;"""What's so criminal about what I know?"""
text27998;"""He looked at me closely, as if he were about to say something, but remained silent."""
text27999;"""Ichinose-san?"""
text28000;"""Nikolai, such a… betrayal… is certainly terrible, but you do realize that they have been spying on more or less all the important people in the Project, right?"""
text28001;"""And, most likely, for a long time now. The question is how closely they have been watching. To be frank, I had no idea your father was of so much interest to all these intelligence agencies."""
text28002;"""Why?"""
text28003;"""Because we were just regular staff members..."""
text28004;"""But he was Russian! How could a Russian be allowed to work on such a secret project in the first place?"""
text28005;"""Not that I hadn't given that some thought before, but not from the point of view of Japan's national security."""
text28006;"""He must've had some knowledge that our local specialists didn't possess."""
text28007;"""Like what?"""
text28008;"""Ichinose went silent for a while and seemed to be staring through me, trying to make something out in the gloom of the night."""
text28009;"""Like the Soviets' understanding of fourth generation intercontinental ballistic missiles."""
text28010;"""I didn't know how to respond to that."""
text28011;"""Nikolai, I am only telling you this, because…"""
text28012;"""He sighed heavily."""
text28013;"""Well, I guess I can't make things any worse by now."""
text28014;"""Ichinose smiled sadly and continued:"""
text28015;"""Besides, your father wasn't informed of every detail…"""
text28016;"""Unlike Akira Shinji?"""
text28017;"""I interrupted him."""
text28018;"""Unlike Akira Shinji..."""
text28019;"""By the way, I happen to know his daughter."""
text28020;"""Little Kagome? I feel sorry for her…"""
text28021;"""What an <i>interesting</i> coincidence it was that we happened to study at the same school!"""
text28022;"""Well, I wouldn't call her little now."""
text28023;"""But you two are in similar situations!"""
text28024;"""Except for the fact that her father might still be alive."""
text28025;"""Let's hope he is…"""
text28026;"""A cold wind blew from the shore — dark, leaden clouds were approaching us from the east, bringing with them heavy rain and morning fog."""
text28027;"""It's already late, Nikolai."""
text28028;"""Ichinose looked at me somehow sympathetically."""
text28029;"""Late for what? From another point of view, it might be too early. And what does it even matter what time it is? What am I supposed to do now?"""
text28030;"""I can't trust anyone anymore. It's not even so much about Kobayashi Corporation or your damn Project! It's about…"""
text28031;"""I didn't finish the sentence because there wasn't much sense in it – Ichinose could only sympathize with me, and even then more for the sake of politeness, as he couldn't fully understand my situation and circumstances."""
text28032;"""He couldn't put himself in my shoes."""
text28033;"""And I was disgusted by that sort of routine sympathy!"""
text28034;"""Just like at my parents' funeral…"""
text28035;"""Familiar and unfamiliar people would approach me and give their condolences, the men would give me a firm handshake, the women would wipe off their tears with handkerchiefs or softly pat me on my shoulder."""
text28036;"""And then everyone just left me alone in that huge, empty house with my grief and sorrow, and only Himitsu was near."""
text28037;"""No, feelings like that couldn't be faked, the question was whether she could combine them with fulfilling her <i>duty to the Motherland</i>."""
text28038;"""I laughed."""
text28039;"""Ichinose-san, can you see the state I'm in? I suspect my own childhood friend — practically a sister — of being a spy!"""
text28040;"""I can already imagine her taking the oath and marching with a gun on her shoulder! It's over!"""
text28041;"""I can't keep on living, pretending nothing happened. Living \""like normal\""!"""
text28042;"""And I hadn't even told Ichinose about that conversation with Irina."""
text28043;"""Something was stopping me from doing it — after all, it wasn't him that the KGB threatened."""
text28044;"""Even though we were being spied on before, at least I didn't know! Now… What happens now?"""
text28045;"""I wish I could help you…"""
text28046;"""Ichinose said heavily."""
text28047;"""But, in any case, you should worry about yourself first, not about your friend."""
text28048;"""It's easy to say that!"""
text28049;"""Indeed, during the last twenty-four hours, Himitsu had been of more concern to me than my own safety."""
text28050;"""And, if you don't give <i>them</i> a reason, they won't have one!"""
text28051;"""He smiled and took a few steps back."""
text28052;"""You should return home before sunrise to avoid raising suspicion."""
text28053;"""You're right, I guess."""
text28054;"""We bid each other farewell, and I walked to the nearest telephone box to call a taxi."""
text28055;"""I had to wait a while — I wasn't in the centre of Tokyo, after all — so by the time the car arrived, I was chilled to the bone."""
text28056;"""…"""
text28057;"""The sun began to rise behind the window, but my thoughts about my conversation with Ichinose kept me from falling asleep."""
text28058;"""Ballistic missiles? <w>Was it that serious?"""
text28059;"""Really, the words just sounded menacing."""
text28060;"""Missiles, bridges — what did it matter to me?"""
text28061;"""It'd been clear for a while that he hadn't been making toys there!"""
text28062;"""I wondered if Himitsu was in danger."""
text28063;"""After all, everyone knows what they did to useless soldiers in ancient Japan…"""

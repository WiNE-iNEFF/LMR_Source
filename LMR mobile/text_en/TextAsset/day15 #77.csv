text16299;"""I was rarely enthusiastic about the start of a week."""
text16300;"""I was only eighteen, and as such hadn't yet felt the inexorable passing of time."""
text16301;"""The end of one set of seven days and the beginning of another felt like turning over to another lined page in a thick notebook."""
text16302;"""No matter how many times I did it — the end was nowhere near!"""
text16303;"""Except there was no erasing the things written on previous pages."""
text16304;"""There was one good thing though — today I could see Ellie again!"""
text16305;"""With that in mind, I quickly got up, washed myself, had a quick breakfast, and went to school."""
text16306;"""You're early today."""
text16307;"""Kyosuke noted with surprise."""
text16308;"""You too."""
text16309;"""How was your weekend?"""
text16310;"""I wondered how he'd react if he found out that Ellie and I were playing in the same band now."""
text16311;"""The thought made me smile like an idiot."""
text16312;"""They wouldn't kick me out before I could tell him, would they…?"""
text16313;"""Much better than mine, I see."""
text16314;"""Kyosuke muttered sadly and sighed."""
text16315;"""Can't complain. But I'll let it stay a secret for now."""
text16316;"""Trying to maximise the element of surprise?"""
text16317;"""I'd rather not attract too much attention ahead of time."""
text16318;"""Attract attention? You've got my curiosity!"""
text16319;"""He was about to say something else, but the appearance of the principal, who suddenly entered the classroom, didn't let him."""
text16320;"""Instead of your first class, the whole school is to meet in the yard."""
text16321;"""Has something happened?"""
text16322;"""One of the girls asked anxiously."""
text16323;"""You'll learn everything there."""
text16324;"""By Kiyama-sensei's face, it was clear he wasn't going to talk about a school trip."""
text16325;"""I suddenly felt a sinking feeling in my stomach."""
text16326;"""What do you think is on his mind?"""
text16327;"""Kyosuke giggled сonspiratorialy and elbowed my side."""
text16328;"""Think it's related to your little secret?"""
text16329;"""What if they're going to say that somebody poured shit all over the principal's office?!"""
text16330;"""I swear, what I smelled when I was passing by this morning…"""
text16331;"""Would you calm down already?"""
text16332;"""Fifteen minutes later, the entire school had gathered in the yard."""
text16333;"""The principal walked up to a podium that had been brought from somewhere, looked over the crowd, coughed a few times, and began:"""
text16334;"""This morning I bring you terrible news. Yesterday, several students of our school tragically died."""
text16335;"""More precisely, they were brutally murdered! Horribly, and with exceptional cruelty."""
text16336;"""Kiyama-sensei wasn't holding back and clearly wasn't reading from a script."""
text16337;"""From the moment he started to speak, the yard was plunged into complete silence, replacing the students' usual whispers and giggles."""
text16338;"""I cannot find any excuse for whoever could do something like this…"""
text16339;"""But be assured — and I'll see to it personally! — that the culprits will be found and punished according to the strictest standards of the law!"""
text16340;"""He paused again and looked over the crowd, not holding his gaze on anyone particular."""
text16341;"""I was naturally shocked, but didn't yet know how to feel."""
text16342;"""When you're told the plane you just missed has crashed, your first thought is: I'm glad I was late."""
text16343;"""Objectively, you don't feel as strongly about strangers dying as you do people you know."""
text16344;"""And who were those kids to me?"""
text16345;"""We studied at the same school — with hundreds of other people!"""
text16346;"""And then the principal started reading out the names:"""
text16347;"""… Asakura… Kawashima…"""
text16348;"""Terror paralyzed my whole body, and my heart seemed to have stopped beating."""
text16349;"""After a couple seconds, I managed to force myself to slowly turn my head in search of Kagome."""
text16350;"""Everything's fine now. I handled it."""
text16351;"""Her words had sounded strange to me yesterday, but I couldn't even imagine then that…"""
text16352;"""Kagome was standing not too far away and didn't look particularly shocked."""
text16353;"""No, of course, there was clear surprise on her face — but no more than on the others'."""
text16354;"""Meanwhile, the principal kept talking."""
text16355;"""…when we're entering an age of stability, prosperity, and order!"""
text16356;"""The Japanese nation will not tolerate scum who prey upon what we hold most dear — our future, our children!"""
text16357;"""Kawashima, Asakura, those thugs too…"""
text16358;"""Kagome might be good with a kitchen knife, but it was hard for me to imagine her taking out one person, let alone eight!"""
text16359;"""And if not for what she had said yesterday — would I be suspicious of her now?"""
text16360;"""After all, the victims were far from angels — I was sure they weren't on the best terms, and to various degrees, with plenty of people."""
text16361;"""…the reputation of our school as an education institution of the highest standard that prioritizes not only knowledge, but also the safety of its students!"""
text16362;"""Even the most tragic memorial has to end in time or it risks turning into a boring sermon."""
text16363;"""Nick? Nick!"""
text16364;"""Kyosuke, standing next to me, had been trying to attract my attention for a while already."""
text16365;"""What?"""
text16366;"""Kawashima, Asakura… Don't you think that's strange?"""
text16367;"""Why?"""
text16368;"""They're connected to Iwamura…"""
text16369;"""Do I look like Commissaire Maigret to you?"""
text16370;"""I barked at him — but a bit louder than I wanted to: a few schoolgirls turned to us and stared at us with suspicion for a moment."""
text16371;"""I ask you for your understanding as an investigation is conducted at our school."""
text16372;"""I also ask for your assistance may the officers have any questions."""
text16373;"""I looked at Kagome again, but she didn't show much of a reaction to Kiyama-sensei's words, she just kept standing there with the appropriately surprised look on her face."""
text16374;"""On the other hand, what, was she supposed to be smirking or going into hysterics?"""
text16375;"""Either extreme would've been more suspicious than her current behavior."""
text16376;"""Still, I couldn't shake off the thought that she had a motive!"""
text16377;"""And even if it was unlikely she would come to me to brag…"""
text16378;"""First she killed eight people in cold blood, then, apparently, washed up, changed her clothes, had dinner, and… <w>travelled to the other side of the city to tell a classmate she'd dealt with them!"""
text16379;"""Without even specifying how!"""
text16380;"""Considering only the facts I had, the situation looked absolutely absurd!"""
text16381;"""No, not the unfortunate deaths, but the fact that I was standing here and seriously blaming Kagome for it."""
text16382;"""We shall not kowtow to these bastards and surrender to fear!"""
text16383;"""Therefore, I have no intention of making any changes to the school schedule."""
text16384;"""However, all students are to leave the school premises by six o'clock."""
text16385;"""The place and the date of the memorial service will be announced separately."""
text16386;"""And for now…"""
text16387;"""He stopped and sighed heavily."""
text16388;"""I ask you all to return to your classrooms and continue studying. I'm sure that's what your friends would have wanted!"""
text16389;"""Right, I could just imagine Asakura poring over textbooks!"""
text16390;"""Although, \""speak no ill of the dead\"", right?"""
text16391;"""The students started to disperse; the majority of them were quiet and only a few exchanged brief phrases, mostly in whispers."""
text16392;"""Let's go, Nick?"""
text16393;"""Go first, I'll catch up."""
text16394;"""Kyosuke looked at me in understanding and returned to school without arguing."""
text16395;"""I, on the other hand, had to talk to Kagome."""
text16396;"""And I had to do it as soon as possible!"""
text16397;"""But Ellie was faster than me."""
text16398;"""She'd already lunged at Iwamura:"""
text16399;"""You bitch, you killed my friends!"""
text16400;"""I knew you were crazy, but I couldn't even imagine how!"""
text16401;"""And if someone else had been in her place, I think a fight would have broken out."""
text16402;"""Girls, let's step away!"""
text16403;"""The students still in the yard were observing the arising conflict with interest."""
text16404;"""No way! Let everyone know what she's done!"""
text16405;"""Let's step away!"""
text16406;"""I repeated insistently, grabbed both of them by the hands, and dragged them aside."""
text16407;"""Let me go! I refuse to listen to another sob story!"""
text16408;"""It doesn't matter if they were guilty or not! A couple insults don't justify murder!"""
text16409;"""<i>A couple insults<i>."""
text16410;"""Kagome smirked."""
text16411;"""See, she's not even denying it!"""
text16412;"""Ellie, calm down!"""
text16413;"""Think about it, how could Kagome… alone… eight people…"""
text16414;"""I was picking my words carefully."""
text16415;"""Who told you she was alone?!"""
text16416;"""Sure. I'm the one with an army of bodyguards."""
text16417;"""She continued with the inappropriate irony."""
text16418;"""And you should watch what you say."""
text16419;"""Or what? You'll put me behind bars?"""
text16420;"""I'm not a policeman. But the police will quickly figure out that you weren't on the best of terms with them."""
text16421;"""I was on no terms with any of them."""
text16422;"""Why would you raise needless suspicion?"""
text16423;"""Just you wait! The police will sort it out! And if they don't, we'll help them!"""
text16424;"""Is that a threat?"""
text16425;"""Exactly!"""
text16426;"""I'm looking forward to it!"""
text16427;"""Kagome really was acting weirdly."""
text16428;"""Once trapped — you fight?"""
text16429;"""But there was something else to her behavior."""
text16430;"""Happiness, delight, or… <w>pride?"""
text16431;"""Like a criminal taken to her execution — a desire to spit in the face of her torturers one last time."""
text16432;"""Sometimes it's better keep your mouth shut."""
text16433;"""I wasn't the one who started this."""
text16434;"""Kagome replied, deliberately ignoring Ellie."""
text16435;"""A few days in a cell will wipe that nasty smirk off your face!"""
text16436;"""…"""
text16437;"""This conversation had to end. <w>One way or another."""
text16438;"""Let's not accuse anybody prematurely…"""
text16439;"""Nick, I can't believe you're protecting her!"""
text16440;"""Even if I was, I didn't mean to — I just couldn't wrap my mind around the idea that she could kill eight people in a single night."""
text16441;"""And, unlike Ellie, I was more concerned with the technical aspect of the matter than the moral one."""
text16442;"""Kagome obviously had a motive, but if every bullied teenager took out their tormentors in cold blood, our schools would be drowning in red!"""
text16443;"""You can think whatever you want about Iwamura, but just look at her! Does she look like a maniac to you?"""
text16444;"""Ellie pursed her lips and looked away."""
text16445;"""It doesn't matter… Who else could...? They had no enemies."""
text16446;"""Oh yeah, sure!"""
text16447;"""Kagome kept sneering."""
text16448;"""Stop it already! You were the one who told me yesterday that you <i>handled</i> them!"""
text16449;"""…it just slipped out."""
text16450;"""Her behavior wasn't just weird, it was provocative."""
text16451;"""Whaaat?!"""
text16452;"""Ellie started back up."""
text16453;"""And you just can't keep your mouth shut!"""
text16454;"""What, were you going to hide it from the police too?"""
text16455;"""You don't need to tell <i>me</i> exactly what you meant when you said you <i>handled</i> whatever it was, but you can't hide it from them."""
text16456;"""Her expression changed."""
text16457;"""Do you really believe that I could… that I'm capable of it?!"""
text16458;"""Yes, I'm not upset by what happened to them — what, am I supposed to spend the entire time in tears to avoid suspicion?"""
text16459;"""No, but at least behave more… appropriately."""
text16460;"""Appropriately to what?!"""
text16461;"""She broke into a shout."""
text16462;"""Your expectations? I don't give a damn…"""
text16463;"""You know, I think I'd rather speak to the police if they've got any questions for me."""
text16464;"""Oh no, you wait! What do you mean, you <i>handled them</i>?"""
text16465;"""Stay away or you'll regret it!"""
text16466;"""Kagome swung at her, mostly just as a threat, but I still pulled Ellie to me abruptly, and she ended up in my arms."""
text16467;"""Iwamura quickly returned to the school."""
text16468;"""Nick, I'm scared. I'm afraid to even be near her."""
text16469;"""I didn't know what to say."""
text16470;"""For a while, we stood there silently: I was holding Ellie in a firm hug, while she kept her head on my chest."""
text16471;"""Finally, it was time to come back to reality."""
text16472;"""I'm not justifying Iwamura's actions, but…"""
text16473;"""But what?"""
text16474;"""There was a lot to criticize Kagome for, but she wasn't stupid and had to understand that soon enough Ellie wouldn't be the only person to suspect her."""
text16475;"""In that case, her behavior seemed even weirder."""
text16476;"""Do you really think she could kill eight people on her own?"""
text16477;"""I don't know what to think… But who else?! What's more, in a single night!"""
text16478;"""Yes, that was important."""
text16479;"""If it were a serial killer, they'd much rather be killing their victims one after another, but not all at once."""
text16480;"""So there had to be a connection, something to tie all eight of them together."""
text16481;"""They'd been in the same friend group — that was clear, but, apart from that, nothing else came to my mind."""
text16482;"""You know… knew them better."""
text16483;"""I'm not saying they were the best of people, but… how do you do something like this?! Who could possibly…"""
text16484;"""Ellie burst into tears, and I had to hug her again to somehow pacify her."""
text16485;"""There, there… I'm sure the police will find the murderer in no time."""
text16486;"""I hope so."""
text16487;"""And it's really hard for me to see you protecting Iwamura, because…"""
text16488;"""She went silent for a long while, as if she never planned to finish the phrase."""
text16489;"""Just don't do it anymore."""
text16490;"""…"""
text16491;"""Will you promise?"""
text16492;"""I'm not protecting Iwamura, I'm trying to think logically."""
text16493;"""I don't want logic! I know it's her fault! Even if she didn't kill them herself…"""
text16494;"""Ellie, but…"""
text16495;"""Because before she hit Miku, everything had been fine. And before…"""
text16496;"""This sort of emotional fatalism was outright alien to me — when events, oftentimes insignificant ones, are given importance great enough to change people's fates."""
text16497;"""But it wasn't prudent to tell Ellie that."""
text16498;"""Class is about to start. I mean, we need to live on somehow. Do you understand?"""
text16499;"""Mhm."""
text16500;"""She replied quietly, wiped her tears, and stepped away from me."""
text16501;"""But be sure, I'll do everything so that the killer, whoever they are, gets what they deserve!"""
text16502;"""I wouldn't expect any less of you!"""
text16503;"""Kagome wasn't in the classroom, her desk was empty."""
text16504;"""Well, no wonder."""
text16505;"""I'd returned right before the bell rang and I was on tenterhooks the entire class."""
text16506;"""But at least I had an opportunity to think everything through."""
text16507;"""What if the Corporation was somehow involved in this too?"""
text16508;"""But why would Kobayashi Jun kill children who were clearly not a threat to him…?"""
text16509;"""Kyosuke approached me as soon as break started, and Michael followed."""
text16510;"""Nick, I saw you talking with Ellie-sama and Iwamura from the window. I decided I better not get involved."""
text16511;"""Thanks for that."""
text16512;"""So, do you think that… Iwamura did it?"""
text16513;"""I rolled my eyes in anguish."""
text16514;"""How, do you think, could a little girl take down eight people, including a few decently strong guys?"""
text16515;"""But then what were you talking about? Especially with Ellie-sama…"""
text16516;"""Ellie, Ellie… What does she have to do with anything?"""
text16517;"""But Nick, you can't deny that Asakura and Kawashima were her friends."""
text16518;"""His words made me feel nothing but irritation."""
text16519;"""There exists a type of extremely pedantic person who is destined to notice and correct every little inaccuracy, especially in the words of the people they talk to."""
text16520;"""But sometimes, dry facts aren't what a situation requires; intonations, hints, shades of meaning, intuition, and emotions are more important."""
text16521;"""Michael either couldn't understand or deliberately ignored it all."""
text16522;"""How many times have we had this conversation this week? I've lost count."""
text16523;"""But people have died!"""
text16524;"""People die every day…"""
text16525;"""Just don't say you don't give a damn!"""
text16526;"""I do, but I'm not about to mourn them either! I barely knew them."""
text16527;"""Unlike Iwamura."""
text16528;"""Again…"""
text16529;"""Just that moment, the principal entered the class and announced right in the doorway:"""
text16530;"""The police are working in our school at the moment. You'll be questioned one person at a time. Once your surname is called, please stand up calmly, walk out of the classroom without disturbing the lesson, and go to my office."""
text16531;"""That will be all."""
text16532;"""\""Interrogation, interrogation\"" — our classmates were whispering."""
text16533;"""I felt uncomfortable and tried my best not to show it to my friends."""
text16534;"""Nick, you look a bit pale…"""
text16535;"""Can't hide a cat in a bag, I guess."""
text16536;"""Anyone would feel uncomfortable about a police interrogation!"""
text16537;"""If they have something to hide."""
text16538;"""Oh, screw you!"""
text16539;"""I crossed my arms over my chest and turned away."""
text16540;"""The next class started, and my concern grew with every second."""
text16541;"""Yes, I had something to hide."""
text16542;"""Yesterday's conversation with Iwamura at my place, for one."""
text16543;"""It was still too early for the police to suspect her.<w> Still, I couldn't think of anyone else better suited to the role, no matter how hard I tried."""
text16544;"""Of course, eventually it was my turn."""
text16545;"""Pretty soon, too — my surname was right at the top of the list of names in our class."""
text16546;"""There were two policemen in the principal's office."""
text16547;"""The younger and taller one was obviously the bad cop, while his partner — an old, fat, round-faced lieutenant — was supposed to be the good one."""
text16548;"""In reality it played out a little differently, with both taking turns asking me questions without much interest or emotion."""
text16549;"""Like lab technicians would question the hundredth subject in an experiment analyzing how the length of the working day effects productivity."""
text16550;"""They were mostly asking about Asakura, her relationships with other students, and specifically inquired if she had any enemies."""
text16551;"""I answered honestly and said we'd never really known each other personally."""
text16552;"""But the entire interrogation I didn't know where to look, mostly staring unblinkingly at one detective or the other."""
text16553;"""My hands were suddenly several times heavier — I had to carefully fold them in front of me on the table and make a conscious effort to keep them from twitching"""
text16554;"""Then my back and buttocks became numb — I straightened out unnaturally and froze in this position."""
text16555;"""But the investigators still looked bored and didn't seem to pay any attention to my unnatural behaviour."""
text16556;"""At the start of the conversation, the young one was making notes in his notebook, but soon enough he put it aside and absent-mindedly looked at the bonsai tree on the principal's table."""
text16557;"""When the torture was over, I walked out of the office with a sense of relief."""
text16558;"""…"""
text16559;"""After Michael and Kyosuke both went through their interrogations, we met at my desk again during the next break."""
text16560;"""Well! Spill it!"""
text16561;"""He started impatiently like we were discussing an episode of a new anime."""
text16562;"""There's nothing to \""spill\"" — I'm sure they asked you the same questions."""
text16563;"""And what did you say?"""
text16564;"""That I've never known Asakura. That she didn't seem to have any enemies, but I'm not sure. That our class is pretty normal."""
text16565;"""Hmmmm…"""
text16566;"""Kyosuke replied, disappointed."""
text16567;"""What, you thought they'd go after me with extreme prejudice? Maybe you suspect me too, and not just Iwamura?!"""
text16568;"""I'd said it mostly as a joke, but Kyosuke became noticeably anxious.."""
text16569;"""No, no, Nick, what are you saying?!"""
text16570;"""Kyosuke, really, this isn't a mystery novel. Real people have died, and police work is far more complicated in real life."""
text16571;"""I understand that!"""
text16572;"""He said offendedly."""
text16573;"""But it's like you two aren't curious at all! What if there's a maniac hunting down our students?"""
text16574;"""It's not Kagome anymore?"""
text16575;"""I smirked."""
text16576;"""I'll ask my dad to get the details from the police."""
text16577;"""His father was some type of government employee in a municipality, and I strongly doubted that he'd have the authority to intervene in a police investigation."""
text16578;"""But I'm not going to tell you a word if you're not interested!"""
text16579;"""What a pity."""
text16580;"""On one hand, Kyosuke's impulsive interest in the case was downright stupid, but on the other — what if I had reasons to worry about his life, too?"""
text16581;"""No, the idea that there was some maniac didn't hold up to scrutiny, but somebody <i>had</i> killed eight boys and girls from our school."""
text16582;"""It did seem like we had reason to think we were being hunted…"""
text16583;"""Although I'd be more careful if I were you."""
text16584;"""Why?"""
text16585;"""Well, you're the one making theories — try to imagine <i>why</i>."""
text16586;"""Nick, don't scare Kyosuke, seriously."""
text16587;"""I'm not scaring him, just giving a warning. What if the victims also enjoyed reading pulp fiction but had somehow managed to come across something important?"""
text16588;"""I could hardly imagine Asakura being interested in anything except boys, fashion magazines, gossip, parties, and karaoke."""
text16589;"""Do you seriously think that…"""
text16590;"""No, not seriously!"""
text16591;"""I interrupted him."""
text16592;"""And let's stop at that for now."""
text16593;"""But I'm still going to talk to dad."""
text16594;"""If you want."""
text16595;"""I decided to go to the canteen during break, but in the corridor I ran into a girl who'd been restlessly fidgeting at the door to our classroom."""
text16596;"""Ah!"""
text16597;"""She loudly exclaimed and jumped back a meter."""
text16598;"""Sorry…"""
text16599;"""I grumbled and was about to move on — I didn't feel particularly guilty."""
text16600;"""Wait."""
text16601;"""She said timidly and stared at me with pleading eyes."""
text16602;"""Is Asakura-san… was she in your class...?"""
text16603;"""She looked down apologetically."""
text16604;"""Yeah. Did you know each other?"""
text16605;"""Not really…"""
text16606;"""My first thought was: what if this girl knows something about Asakura and Kawashima?"""
text16607;"""What's your name? What class are you in?"""
text16608;"""I'm…"""
text16609;"""She suddenly started crying."""
text16610;"""What's wrong?!"""
text16611;"""I had enough dysfunctional girls in my life!"""
text16612;"""Let's step aside!"""
text16613;"""I took her firmly by the arm and pulled her away."""
text16614;"""Soon we were in the old school wing."""
text16615;"""The girl was all tensed up and looking at me warily."""
text16616;"""What do you know about what happened? You know they were killed, right?"""
text16617;"""I mean, of course you do, the entire school was out there…"""
text16618;"""How are you connected to them?"""
text16619;"""I'm…"""
text16620;"""What if she was also in their clique?"""
text16621;"""Sorry, I don't even know your name."""
text16622;"""It's alright."""
text16623;"""The girl's smile looked absolutely inappropriate."""
text16624;"""No, she bore more resemblance with Kagome."""
text16625;"""Have they been picking on you?"""
text16626;"""She moved her head vaguely, as if trying to see something at the end of the corridor."""
text16627;"""An odd girl. <w>A fitting target for Asakura's gang."""
text16628;"""I just have a friend… an acquaintance… who suffered because of them. If you did too, it'd help us a lot."""
text16629;"""Although, how exactly? <w>She absolutely did not look like a murderer."""
text16630;"""I'm just…"""
text16631;"""The girl laughed, then cried again."""
text16632;"""At first I couldn't believe what the principal said. Sure, I wasn't friends with Asakura-san, but I'd never wished her dead."""
text16633;"""She finally got a hold of herself and started speaking normally."""
text16634;"""How many more children in this school were victims of bullying, I wondered."""
text16635;"""How hadn't I noticed it before?"""
text16636;"""And why had this girl so easily agreed to follow me to a deserted location?"""
text16637;"""Don't worry, I'm not going to do anything to you."""
text16638;"""I can see you're not <i>like that</i>."""
text16639;"""You know, when you say that…"""
text16640;"""I let out a sigh and thought about what I was even doing and why."""
text16641;"""Are you from Ellie's… Kobayashi-san's class?"""
text16642;"""She gave a nod of confirmation."""
text16643;"""So you must know Kawashima better?"""
text16644;"""I feel sorry for Kawashima-san too."""
text16645;"""Sorry, yeah…"""
text16646;"""I obviously wasn't justifying the murders, but people die every second in this world, there's not enough time to feel sorry about all of them."""
text16647;"""And in this case, however you look at it, at least some people felt better with them gone."""
text16648;"""Maybe it's for the better."""
text16649;"""For the better?"""
text16650;"""I mean, so many people can breathe easier now without their constant attacks."""
text16651;"""Sure, I didn't always have an easily relationship with Kawashima-san and Asakura-san."""
text16652;"""The girl suddenly frowned."""
text16653;"""But there was a whole life ahead of them — they could've changed in the future."""
text16654;"""Err, yeah, of course…"""
text16655;"""I felt ashamed and tried to quickly change the topic."""
text16656;"""So what did you want?"""
text16657;"""Want?"""
text16658;"""Well, you were looking for someone in our class."""
text16659;"""No, I just dropped by."""
text16660;"""<i>Just</i>, huh...?"""
text16661;"""I let out a sigh."""
text16662;"""Isn't that interesting: stereotypical bullies choose themselves stereotypical victims."""
text16663;"""And everything in nature, and thus in society, is determined by simple cause and effect with heredity and upbringing as their foundation."""
text16664;"""It's all so simple, but does that make things easier for Kagome, for this weird girl… <w>For me?"""
text16665;"""Do you know Iwamura by any chance?"""
text16666;"""I asked without a real reason."""
text16667;"""Who?"""
text16668;"""Iwamura Kagome, she's in my class. She…"""
text16669;"""Did I have the right to tell others about Kagome's problems, even if this girl had had to deal with something similar?"""
text16670;"""No, I don't know her."""
text16671;"""Gotcha."""
text16672;"""I sighed, almost with relief."""
text16673;"""Alright then, sorry for dragging you all the way here."""
text16674;"""I was about to leave, but the girl stopped me:"""
text16675;"""Did you know <i>them</i>?"""
text16676;"""Who? Asakura and Kawashima? Well, I was in the same class as Asakura…"""
text16677;"""Would it sound weird if I said I didn't know my own classmate?"""
text16678;"""Well, compared to this girl it didn't seem hard to not look too strange."""
text16679;"""We never really talked, if that's what you mean."""
text16680;"""I see."""
text16681;"""Why do you ask?"""
text16682;"""Just wondering."""
text16683;"""<i>Just</i>, huh?"""
text16684;"""I repeated and froze half-turned to her, as if waiting for something else."""
text16685;"""But the girl kept silent."""
text16686;"""Alright, then…?"""
text16687;"""Goodbye."""
text16688;"""She smiled and went deeper into the old wing. <w>Why?"""
text16689;"""I spent some time standing in place, thinking about what had just happened."""
text16690;"""Sure, it would be stupid to suspect this weird girl of taking out Asakura and Kawashima's gang."""
text16691;"""But there were obviously plenty of people here who — even if they didn't want them dead — weren't too upset about what had happened."""
text16692;"""Theoretically, if they all worked together…"""
text16693;"""No, that's just stupid!"""
text16694;"""I decisively shook my head and headed back to class."""
text16695;"""Who'd win, ten Iwamuras or ten Asakuras…?"""
text16696;"""Class was over, and Himitsu was waiting for me at the front of the school."""
text16697;"""Niko-kun, I was so worried!"""
text16698;"""That I'd fall asleep in class, drop my head on a pencil, and gouge my eye out?"""
text16699;"""Hey!"""
text16700;"""She pouted."""
text16701;"""A tragedy happened! One of the girls who died was in your class, right?"""
text16702;"""Yeah, Asakura."""
text16703;"""I replied, trying to sound as indifferent as possible."""
text16704;"""Did you know each other?"""
text16705;"""Ah, what am I saying…?"""
text16706;"""Of course, Himitsu was right, but that remark still hurt."""
text16707;"""Much like with Michael, sometimes you want for the truth to exist separately from yourself, in some parallel universe."""
text16708;"""No, we didn't. Asakura, she…"""
text16709;"""I was picking my words carefully."""
text16710;"""She was part of another social circle."""
text16711;"""Is that so?"""
text16712;"""…"""
text16713;"""We were slowly walking home."""
text16714;"""Himitsu was silent almost the entire way, which made me start to feel uncomfortable."""
text16715;"""Our relationship had been far from perfect lately, but right now she was like an ex-wife forced to come to my parents' funeral and obligingly express some amount of sympathy."""
text16716;"""Did Asakura do that?"""
text16717;"""Himitsu asked finally."""
text16718;"""Do what?"""
text16719;"""Your door and the window."""
text16720;"""What made you think that?"""
text16721;"""I wasn't even particularly surprised by her acumen."""
text16722;"""It was just a guess."""
text16723;"""What if she did? You don't think I killed them, do you?"""
text16724;"""She didn't reply."""
text16725;"""You don't, right?"""
text16726;"""I started getting worried."""
text16727;"""No, Niko-kun, of course I don't."""
text16728;"""Doesn't sound like you're sure."""
text16729;"""How can I be when you're hiding so much from me!"""
text16730;"""I'm not… Fine. Even if I don't talk about certain things, why would you jump to that extreme?"""
text16731;"""Not every eighteen-year-old with a few secrets can be a serial killer, don't you think?"""
text16732;"""I don't know what to think anymore, Niko-kun."""
text16733;"""Ten minutes ago, Himitsu had looked genuinely concerned (just like that ex-wife), but now an expression of idle indifference seized her face."""
text16734;"""As if we were talking about something completely insignificant, just mundane stuff."""
text16735;"""And you won't even ask me if I'm in danger?"""
text16736;"""I could, but I already know what you'd say."""
text16737;"""What?"""
text16738;"""<i>Everything's fine, sunshine, don't worry!</i>"""
text16739;"""She said mockingly."""
text16740;"""And in a sense, Himitsu was right — I would indeed have answered along those lines."""
text16741;"""I don't mean that <i>everything's fine</i> in the context of a normal, average person."""
text16742;"""<i>Everything's fine</i> in the context of my life."""
text16743;"""So you don't even want a normal life for yourself?"""
text16744;"""No, that's not what I wanted to say… Damn it! You confused me!"""
text16745;"""You've confused yourself, Niko-kun."""
text16746;"""Here you go again!"""
text16747;"""What do you expect from me? I've already asked you so many times what's going on and I always get the same response."""
text16748;"""Because nothing's going on…"""
text16749;"""I responded unsurely."""
text16750;"""See, that's exactly what I'm talking about."""
text16751;"""Fine. Yes, it was Asakura and her gang who painted over my door and broke the window."""
text16752;"""At least, they didn't try to deny it."""
text16753;"""But why, Niko-kun? What problem did they have with you?"""
text16754;"""Himitsu finally sounded normal again."""
text16755;"""Let's just say I decided I couldn't tolerate injustice."""
text16756;"""I didn't want to tell her anything about Kagome, and I didn't need to."""
text16757;"""But I'm sure their murder has nothing to do with that."""
text16758;"""Injustice?"""
text16759;"""Remember Iwamura? We saw her being bullied at the school gate a couple of weeks ago."""
text16760;"""Iwamura-senpai…"""
text16761;"""Himitsu repeated without much emotion."""
text16762;"""I got tired of watching them pick on her all the time."""
text16763;"""It's strange, Niko-kun, that you paid attention to someone other than yourself."""
text16764;"""So you think I did the wrong thing?"""
text16765;"""I don't know, Niko-kun, it's your life."""
text16766;"""Look, don't you think that's enough already?!"""
text16767;"""We approached my house and I abruptly stopped in the middle of the sidewalk."""
text16768;"""Enough of what?"""
text16769;"""Acting like you don't give a damn!"""
text16770;"""Since when do you care about my opinion?"""
text16771;"""Since always!"""
text16772;"""Then you've been hiding it very well."""
text16773;"""My reaction was apparently very strange, because Himitsu suddenly laughed."""
text16774;"""You should've seen yourself just now, Niko-kun!"""
text16775;"""But any reaction is better than indifference."""
text16776;"""If you tell me everything without leaving anything out, you'll feel better."""
text16777;"""I really doubted that, but the prospect of being left completely alone was even scarier."""
text16778;"""Kagome was suspected of murder — even if only by Ellie for now, but the police would follow soon enough, I was sure of that."""
text16779;"""And I was further from Catherine now than when she had been on the other side of the planet."""
text16780;"""Yes, I had a band to play in, but what did that matter when I was alone as soon as I stepped out of the studio?"""
text16781;"""I need to think."""
text16782;"""Fine, take your time. I'll drop by tonight. Still have a lot of things to do."""
text16783;"""Alright, thank you."""
text16784;"""For what, Niko-kun?"""
text16785;"""For being here!"""
text16786;"""Himitsu smiled mysteriously."""
text16787;"""…"""
text16788;"""Asakura and Kawashima really did choose a terrible time to die!"""
text16789;"""Just when things finally seemed to be getting better!"""
text16790;"""I was walking back and forth, my mind busy endlessly running through different scenarios of what could happen next."""
text16791;"""Even if the police suspected Kagome, she could easily have an alibi."""
text16792;"""Why hadn't I thought to ask her right away?!"""
text16793;"""And if she really did have one… <w>then things were going to get even more complicated!"""
text16794;"""Was it really easier for me to believe that Kagome was the murderer?"""
text16795;"""To distract myself from those dark thoughts, I took the bass guitar and started learning the new songs I'd been given."""
text16796;"""I found an old book on solfeggio in a closet, which helped me to quickly grasp the basics."""
text16797;"""And that was just enough to understand the rows of symbols that I'd previously found illegible."""
text16798;"""It's interesting to see how a part you initially found impossible becomes simple with enough practice."""
text16799;"""You just have to play it a hundred times!"""
text16800;"""It was getting late, my fingers hurt, and my back was numb from sitting in the same position for so long."""
text16801;"""I had to take a break, but I kept telling myself I'd play just one more song, then stop."""
text16802;"""I probably would have played to the point of total exhaustion if the doorbell hadn't rung."""
text16803;"""The unexpected guest turned out to be Ellie."""
text16804;"""Thank you!"""
text16805;"""I blurted out right on the doorstep."""
text16806;"""For what?"""
text16807;"""If not for you I would have played myself to death on my bass."""
text16808;"""Really?"""
text16809;"""Please come in!"""
text16810;"""Ellie was noticeably nervous and wasn't even trying to hide it."""
text16811;"""I came for a reason, actually."""
text16812;"""And here I was hoping you just missed me!"""
text16813;"""I tried to make a stupid joke, but she clearly wasn't in the mood."""
text16814;"""It's about your friend… Iwamura…"""
text16815;"""Since when are we friends?"""
text16816;"""Sure seems like it from the outside."""
text16817;"""Well, you know…"""
text16818;"""I crossed my arms and walked round the kitchen."""
text16819;"""I've already told you: her father went missing, and I decided to help."""
text16820;"""Do you help every girl you come across?"""
text16821;"""She asked without any anger, but there was an unusual interest in her voice."""
text16822;"""Only the ones that need it…"""
text16823;"""I grumbled in response."""
text16824;"""Alright, what will you do if I say I need help? My friends have been murdered! Murdered by your friend, acquaintance — call her what you want."""
text16825;"""I really don't think that…"""
text16826;"""Wait, I'm not done yet!"""
text16827;"""Even if there could be any doubt after the principal's speech, her reaction..."""
text16828;"""How would you have reacted, if you were her?"""
text16829;"""I'm not her, thank God! I've already told you that. I don't want to put myself in anyone's shoes — my own are problematic enough."""
text16830;"""Fine, what do you think we should do?"""
text16831;"""We should… we should at least tell the police…"""
text16832;"""Ellie said, stuttering."""
text16833;"""Apparently she didn't have a plan."""
text16834;"""You think they won't figure out that Iwamura and your friends weren't on good terms without us?"""
text16835;"""Of course they will, but…"""
text16836;"""Ellie frowned, as if I was to blame for her lack of a plan to put Kagome behind bars."""
text16837;"""Then I need to talk to my grandfather! Tell him everything!"""
text16838;"""Now that's definitely not a good idea!"""
text16839;"""Especially after he had asked me to keep an eye on Kagome."""
text16840;"""You do realize that your grandfather isn't a fan of half measures, right? What if she's not guilty? Do you want an innocent person to suffer?"""
text16841;"""Why do you immediately assume that my grandfather would do something bad to her?"""
text16842;"""To be honest, for whatever reason nothing else comes to mind."""
text16843;"""I blurted out, but Ellie paid no attention to my tone."""
text16844;"""I can't just wait! What if they don't find the killer?"""
text16845;"""She walked to the table, sat behind it, and folded her arms in front of her."""
text16846;"""How about we let the police do their work."""
text16847;"""I know I have no right to give you any advice — my friends weren't the ones killed — but I still think you're better off thinking things through, so you don't do something stupid."""
text16848;"""My words made no sense — I was just doing my best to distract her from the thought of turning Kagome in. <w>No matter to who — the police or her grandfather."""
text16849;"""But then I tried to put myself in Ellie's place."""
text16850;"""How would I feel if Kyosuke and Michael were killed, and the main suspect was just smirking brazenly at me?"""
text16851;"""Kagome seemed to be almost asking for the blame, regardless of whether she was actually guilty or not."""
text16852;"""To start with, we have no evidence."""
text16853;"""Now, that's definitely the police's job!"""
text16854;"""So you actually do think they're capable of finding the murder weapon, collecting fingerprints, and figuring out the motive on their own?"""
text16855;"""I asked half-jokingly."""
text16856;"""The motive here is as clear as day!"""
text16857;"""I wouldn't be so hasty… Mutual dislike, bullying — sure."""
text16858;"""Maybe I wouldn't even be surprised if Kagome had splashed acid in Asakura's face…"""
text16859;"""But eight people, Ellie! Eight! Do you really believe that Kagome alone could…"""
text16860;"""What if she had an accomplice?!"""
text16861;"""Who, her grandfather? He looks a century old!"""
text16862;"""How would I know?!"""
text16863;"""Ellie snapped and turned away."""
text16864;"""I didn't want continue this conversation."""
text16865;"""If I tried to keep arguing with her, she'd react like a spoiled child, and do the opposite of what I said, just because."""
text16866;"""I couldn't support her accusations against Kagome. <w>For many reasons."""
text16867;"""So the only options I had left were sophistry and trickery."""
text16868;"""Let's assume you're right. Sunday evening, Kagome kills eight people, then Monday morning she goes to school as if nothing happened. Right?"""
text16869;"""Well, she's crazy!"""
text16870;"""I'm sure I wouldn't upset her if I said Kagome does have issues with socialization, but you're talking psychopathy now!"""
text16871;"""Does she look like a psychopath to you?"""
text16872;"""Well… no… I don't know."""
text16873;"""Psychopaths can pretend to be normal!"""
text16874;"""Those, what are they called…? Sociophobes!"""
text16875;"""Sociopaths?"""
text16876;"""Whatever, sociopaths, what's the difference?"""
text16877;"""Sure, in many senses Kagome was in opposition to the existing social order — but only because she understood it well and had to adapt."""
text16878;"""So that hypothesis wasn't valid either."""
text16879;"""Sociopaths are often characterized by a random choice of victims."""
text16880;"""What do you want from me?"""
text16881;"""Ellie pleaded."""
text16882;"""I came here so you'd comfort me, not to listen to a lecture about forensic psychiatry!"""
text16883;"""Really?"""
text16884;"""In many respects, my experience with girls was limited."""
text16885;"""Yes, Himitsu and Catherine were hardly alike, but there were only two of them."""
text16886;"""Meanwhile Kagome, and, moreover, Ellie…"""
text16887;"""I didn't want you to think that I…"""
text16888;"""Relax! I was joking."""
text16889;"""At that moment, I heard Himitsu's voice coming from the hall:"""
text16890;"""Niko-kun, are you not alone?"""
text16891;"""Damn it! <w>She had promised to drop by in the evening… <w>Was it evening already?!"""
text16892;"""Niko-kun?"""
text16893;"""I looked at Ellie and smiled apologetically."""
text16894;"""Niko-kun…"""
text16895;"""But Himitsu's appearance didn't seem to embarrass her in the slightest."""
text16896;"""Sorry, I didn't know you had a guest…"""
text16897;"""Kobayashi-senpai…"""
text16898;"""Himitsu lowered her head and seemed to grow smaller."""
text16899;"""All this excessive politeness looked silly, even comical."""
text16900;"""I won't bother you."""
text16901;"""She turned around, but Ellie stopped her:"""
text16902;"""No, I should be going anyway."""
text16903;"""Sorry!"""
text16904;"""Himitsu almost shouted and ran away."""
text16905;"""What's the matter with her?"""
text16906;"""It's a long story. Where do I even start…"""
text16907;"""Is she your…"""
text16908;"""She started, but I immediately waved my hands, not letting her continue:"""
text16909;"""No, no, we're just friends! Childhood friends! Been living across from each other for ten years, so…"""
text16910;"""<i>So</i> what?"""
text16911;"""Ellie pretended to interrogate me."""
text16912;"""So that's it…"""
text16913;"""Alright, I'm glad."""
text16914;"""About what?"""
text16915;"""About the fact that you've normal <i> friends</i> too."""
text16916;"""Her words made me feel awkward."""
text16917;"""Himitsu is almost like family to me. In fact now, after my parents' death, I have no one closer than her."""
text16918;"""What happened to them?"""
text16919;"""They died in a car accident."""
text16920;"""I'm very sorry. Has it been long?"""
text16921;"""A year and a half."""
text16922;"""And you've been like this all this time… alone?"""
text16923;"""Yeah, I've gotten used to it."""
text16924;"""Sorry! I shouldn't have said all that!"""
text16925;"""She jumped up from the chair."""
text16926;"""It's alright, no worries. Really."""
text16927;"""In any case, now I think you're right. I'm not going to tell grandpa anything for now."""
text16928;"""Thanks for that!"""
text16929;"""And don't forget, we have a rehearsal on Wednesday!"""
text16930;"""Rehearsal? I thought you'd need some time to… well… you know."""
text16931;"""Ellie paused like she was asked about something totally unexpected, <seq el_smile>then gave me a sudden, cute smile."""
text16932;"""I got used to it, too."""
text16933;"""See you!"""
text16934;"""…"""
text16935;"""Got used to what?"""
text16936;"""I didn't have energy left for anything today, and at just eleven PM I was soundly asleep."""
